	abstract = {A theoretical study has been carried out to analyse the behaviour of the structural components used with a modern spoked bicycle wheel when loaded at the hub axle and supported at the rim. The work has involved developing some general equations for calculating the contributions which the axially loaded spokes and the bending flexure of the rim make to hub displacement and hence hub-to-rim wheel stiffness. The work considers the effect which the spoke tightening preload has on the distribution of load throughout the wheel and also the influence it has on wheel stiffness. The developed theory has been applied to some modern racing cycle wheels which have just a few spokes and use a relatively rigid, part tubular cross-section rim. Such designs are evaluated, using actual mechanical properties, and their behaviour is discussed against more traditional multi-spoke wheel designs which have relatively much more flexible rims. The theory has been compared with the results obtained from experimentally load testing a bicycle wheel using 12 and 18 spoke variants.},

	abstract = {PURPOSE: The study's purpose was to determine the respective influences of the maximal power (Pmax) and the force-velocity (F-v) mechanical profile of the lower limb neuromuscular system on performance in ballistic movements.
METHODS: A theoretical integrative approach was proposed to express ballistic performance as a mathematical function of Pmax and F-v profile. This equation was (i) validated from experimental data obtained on 14 subjects during lower limb ballistic inclined push-offs and (ii) simulated to quantify the respective influence of Pmax and F-v profile on performance.
RESULTS: The bias between performances predicted and obtained from experimental measurements was 4\%-7\%, confirming the validity of the proposed theoretical approach. Simulations showed that ballistic performance was mostly influenced not only by Pmax but also by the balance between force and velocity capabilities as described by the F-v profile. For each individual, there is an optimal F-v profile that maximizes performance, whereas unfavorable F-v balances lead to differences in performance up to 30\% for a given Pmax. This optimal F-v profile, which can be accurately determined, depends on some individual characteristics (limb extension range, Pmax) and on the afterload involved in the movement (inertia, inclination). The lower the afterload, the more the optimal F-v profile is oriented toward velocity capabilities and the greater the limitation of performance imposed by the maximal velocity of lower limb extension.
CONCLUSIONS: High ballistic performances are determined by both maximization of the power output capabilities and optimization of the F-v mechanical profile of the lower limb neuromuscular system.},

Twenty-six, Division-I, male, soccer players performed 3 maximum effort countermovement jumps (CMJs) on a dual-force platform system that measured 3-dimensional kinetic data. The trial producing peak jump height was used for analysis. Vertical GRF (Fz) variables were divided into unloading, eccentric, amortization, and concentric phases and correlated with jump height, RSI (RSI = jump height/jump time), and jump time (from start to takeoff). Significant correlations were observed between jump height and RSI, concentric kinetic energy, peak power, concentric work, and concentric displacement. Significant correlations were observed between RSI and jump time, peak power, unload Fz, eccentric work, eccentric rate of force development (RFD), amortization Fz, amortization time, second Fz peak, average concentric Fz, and concentric displacement. Significant correlations were observed between jump time and unload Fz, eccentric work, eccentric RFD, amortization Fz, amortization time, average concentric Fz, and concentric work. In conclusion, jump height correlated with variables derived from the concentric phase only (work, power, and displacement), whereas Fz variables from the unloading, eccentric, amortization, and concentric phases correlated highly with RSI and jump time. These observations demonstrate the importance of countermovement Fz characteristics for time-sensitive CMJ performance measures. Researchers and practitioners should include RSI and jump time with jump height to improve their assessment of jump performance.},

The ﬁrst session involved 1 repetition maximum (1RM) (kg) testing in the squat and power clean. During the second session, peak force (N), relative peak force (NÁkg21), peak power (W), relative peak power (WÁkg21), peak velocity (mÁs21), and jump height (meters) in a CMJ, and peak force and rate of force development (RFD) (NÁs21) in a maximal isometric squat (ISO squat) and maximal isometric mid-thigh pull (ISO mid-thigh) were assessed. Signiﬁcant correlations (P \# 0.05) were found when comparing relative 1RMs (1RM/body mass), in both the squat and power clean, to relative CMJ peak power, CMJ peak velocity, and CMJ height. No signiﬁcant correlations existed between the 4 measures of absolute strength, which did not account for body mass (squat 1RM, power clean 1RM, ISO squat peak force, and ISO mid-thigh peak force) when compared to CMJ peak velocity and CMJ height. In conclusion, multijoint dynamic tests of strength (squat 1RM and power clean 1RM), expressed relative to body mass, are most closely correlated with CMJ performance. These results suggest that increasing maximal strength relative to body mass can improve performance in explosive lower body movements. The squat and power clean, used in a concurrent strength and power training program, are recommended for optimizing lower body power.},

	abstract = {In skateboarding as a sports event, the riders compete in difficulty and completeness of acrobatic motions called “tricks”. As a basic trick, Ollie is performed popularly. However, the basic mechanical principle of the Ollie has not been discussed to date, especially for the Ollie jump (the jumping phase of Ollie). The objective of this study was to elucidate the mechanism of Ollie jump in skateboarding. A simulation model was firstly constructed on a multibody dynamics analysis platform. Next, an experiment using an actual rider was conducted to acquire the motion of the feet during the Ollie jump. By inputting the acquired motion of the feet into the model, a simulation of Ollie jump was carried out. In addition, a parameter study with respect to the geometry of the skateboard and the motion of the rider’s feet was conducted. It was found that the simulated Ollie jump was successful since the skateboard reached a sufficient height and became sufficiently horizontal at the peak height. It was also found that the Ollie jump can be divided into five stages from the mechanical point of view. From the parameter study, it was found that large kick angle of the deck or large distance between two trucks of the deck might cause difficulty in the contact of the tail and the ground, while small kick angle or small distance between two trucks might result in excessive rotating angle of the deck. In addition, three important points for a successful Ollie jump were found to be, to produce sufficiently fast rotational movement of the skateboard around the rear wheels, to separate both feet from the deck before the tail of the deck hits the ground, and to separate the rear foot from the deck at the final stage.},

J Strength Cond Res 28(4): 1096–1105, 2014—The goal of this study was to assess (a) the eccentric rate of force development, the concentric force, and selected time variables on vertical performance during countermovement jump, (b) the existence of gender differences in these variables, and (c) the sportspeciﬁc differences. The sample was composed of 189 males and 84 females, all elite athletes involved in college and professional sports (primarily football, basketball, baseball, and volleyball). The subjects performed a series of 6 countermovement jumps on a force plate (500 Hz). Average eccentric rate of force development (ECC-RFD), total time (TIME), eccentric time (ECC-T), Ratio between eccentric and total time (ECC-T:T) and average force (CON-F) were extracted from force-time curves and the vertical jumping performance, measured by impulse momentum. Results show that CON-F (r = 0.57; p , 0.001) and ECCRFD (r = 0.52, p , 0.001) are strongly correlated with the jump height (JH), whereas the time variables are slightly and negatively correlated (r = 20.21–0.23, p , 0.01). Force variables differ between both sexes (p , 0.01), whereas time variables did not differ, showing a similar temporal structure. The best way to jump high is to increase CON-F and ECC-RFD thus minimizing the ECC-T. Principal component analysis (PCA) accounted for 76.8\% of the JH variance and revealed that JH is predicted by a temporal and a force component. Furthermore, the PCA comparison made among athletes revealed sport-speciﬁc signatures: volleyball players revealed a temporal-prevailing proﬁle, a weakforce with large ECC-T:T for basketball players and explosive and powerful proﬁles for football and baseball players.},

	abstract = {In skateboarding as a sports event, the riders compete in difficulty and completeness of acrobatic motions called "tricks". As a basic trick, Ollie is performed popularly. However, the basic mechanical principle of the Ollie has not been discussed to date, especially for the Ollie jump (the jumping phase of Ollie). The objective of this study was to elucidate the mechanism of Ollie jump in skateboarding. A simulation model was firstly constructed on a multibody dynamics analysis platform. Next, an experiment using an actual rider was conducted to acquire the motion of the feet during the Ollie jump. By inputting the acquired motion of the feet into the model, a simulation of Ollie jump was carried out. In addition, a parameter study with respect to the geometry of the skateboard and the motion of the rider's feet was conducted. It was found that the simulated Ollie jump was successful since the skateboard reached a sufficient height and became sufficiently horizontal at the peak height. It was also found that the Ollie jump can be divided into five stages from the mechanical point of view. From the parameter study, it was found that large kick angle of the deck or large distance between two trucks of the deck might cause difficulty in the contact of the tail and the ground, while small kick angle or small distance between two trucks might result in excessive rotating angle of the deck. In addition, three important points for a successful Ollie jump were found to be, to produce sufficiently fast rotational movement of the skateboard around the rear wheels, to separate both feet from the deck before the tail of the deck hits the ground, and to separate the rear foot from the deck at the final stage.},

	abstract = {Impact mechanics is concerned with the reaction forces that develop during a collision and the dynamic response of structures to these reaction forces. The subject has a wide range of engineering applications, from designing sports equipment to improving the crashworthiness of automobiles. This book develops several different methodologies for analysing collisions between structures. These range from rigid body theory for structures that are stiff and compact, to vibration and wave analyses for flexible structures. The emphasis is on low-speed impact where damage is local to the small region of contact between the colliding bodies. The analytical methods presented give results that are more robust or less sensitive to initial conditions than have been achieved hitherto. As a text, Impact Mechanics builds upon foundation courses in dynamics and strength of materials. It includes numerous industrially relevant examples and end-of-chapter homework problems drawn from industry and sports. Practising engineers will also find the methods presented in this book useful in calculating the response of a mechanical system to impact.},

	abstract = {The quantiﬁcation of mechanical power can provide valuable insight into athlete performance because it is the mechanical principle of the rate at which the athlete does work or transfers energy to complete a movement task. Estimates of power are usually limited by the capabilities of measurement systems, resulting in the use of simpliﬁed power models. This review provides a systematic overview of the studies on mechanical power in sports, discussing the application and estimation of mechanical power, the consequences of simpliﬁcations, and the terminology. The mechanical power balance consists of ﬁve parts, where joint power is equal to the sum of kinetic power, gravitational power, environmental power, and frictional power. Structuring literature based on these power components shows that simpliﬁcations in models are done on four levels, single vs multibody models, instantaneous power (IN) versus change in energy (EN), the dimensions of a model (1D, 2D, 3D), and neglecting parts of the mechanical power balance. Quantifying the consequences of simpliﬁcation of power models has only been done for running, and shows differences ranging from 10\% up to 250\% compared to joint power models. Furthermore, inconsistency and imprecision were found in the determination of joint power, resulting from inverse dynamics methods, incorporation of translational joint powers, partitioning in negative and positive work, and power ﬂow between segments. Most inconsistency in terminology was found in the deﬁnition and application of ‘external’ and ‘internal’ work and power. Sport research would beneﬁt from structuring the research on mechanical power in sports and quantifying the result of simpliﬁcations in mechanical power estimations.},

It is also of vital importance for simulating robots, virtual reality, and realistic animation. However, correctly modeling rigid-body dynamics with friction is diﬃcult due to a number of discontinuities in the behavior of rigid bodies and the discontinuities inherent in the Coulomb friction law. This is particularly crucial for handling situations with large coeﬃcients of friction, which can result in paradoxical results known at least since Painlev´e [C. R. Acad. Sci. Paris, 121 (1895), pp. 112–115]. This single example has been a counterexample and cause of controversy ever since, and only recently have there been rigorous mathematical results that show the existence of solutions to his example.},

	abstract = {This paper offers an active inference account of choice behaviour and learning. It focuses on the distinction between goal-directed and habitual behaviour and how they contextualise each other. We show that habits emerge naturally (and autodidactically) from sequential policy optimisation when agents are equipped with state-action policies. In active inference, behaviour has explorative (epistemic) and exploitative (pragmatic) aspects that are sensitive to ambiguity and risk respectively, where epistemic (ambiguity-resolving) behaviour enables pragmatic (reward-seeking) behaviour and the subsequent emergence of habits. Although goal-directed and habitual policies are usually associated with model-based and model-free schemes, we find the more important distinction is between belief-free and belief-based schemes. The underlying (variational) belief updating provides a comprehensive (if metaphorical) process theory for several phenomena, including the transfer of dopamine responses, reversal learning, habit formation and devaluation. Finally, we show that active inference reduces to a classical (Bellman) scheme, in the absence of ambiguity.},

	abstract = {The Human body center of gravity vary and constantly change according to the activity that is being performed. It is important for stability and balance.Since the human body is not a rigid body, the location of the center of gravity depends on the position of the limbs and the distribution of mass throughout the body. Stability is an important factor in many sports and human movement activities which depends in the first place on the position of the center of gravity. The aim of this study is to design a small simple model for human body that used to detrmine the center of gravity of the human body and can be used later in different sports activites studies.This study showsthat thereis more than one way to design a model for human body, but the segmentation method is the best because it’s simple and gives results close to the theoretical ones so it can be used in the sport medicineresearches.The studying of human body model as a separatedparts models need time for designing, working, and calculating but in the same time is give more accurate results than studying the whole body as one part.The percentage of height of the center of gravity to the total body height is 60\% in mean, which represents the point located in the lower torso, slightly below the waist and in the pelvic region.},

	abstract = {Countermovement jumps (CMJs) are widely used in athlete training, performance monitoring and research as an indicator of power output. Despite extensive scientific research on CMJs, data for elite track and field athletes is limited, particularly for non-sprint events and female athletes. The purpose of this study was threefold: (i) to compare CMJ performance between elite sprinters and high jumpers; (ii) to compare CMJ performance between elite male and female athletes in these two events; and (iii) to determine which CMJ take-off parameters correlated most strongly with jump height. Twenty-seven elite athletes (sprinters: nine male and seven female; high jumpers: five male and six female) completed three maximal CMJs. Jump height and take-off phase parameters were obtained from the force?time data and compared between groups; additionally, time series comparisons were performed on the force, power and displacement data. There was no difference in jump height or any of the take-off parameters between the sprinters and high jumpers; however, the time series analysis indicated that the sprinters maintained a lower centre of mass position during the latter concentric phase. The male athletes jumped higher than the female athletes (by 10.0 cm or 24.2\%; p {\textless} 0.001) with significantly greater body weight normalised peak power (17.9\%, p = 0.002) and significantly shorter eccentric time (17.4\%, p = 0.035). Jump height was most strongly correlated with peak power. In addition, jump height was also strongly correlated with positive impulse and both minimum and mean concentric centre of mass position. These results support the importance of accounting for event and gender when investigating CMJ performance.},

Experiments were carried out by the sliding of the bare foot and foot wearing shoes against emery papers of different grit sizes. The friction coefficient was investigated. Based on the experimental observations, it was found that,at dry sliding of bare foot and foot wearing shoes, the reference tested emery paper displayed lower friction values than the majority of the tested emery papers. The highest friction values were displayed by 100 grit number emery paper. Shoe 1 displayed relatively lower friction values than bare foot. Shoe 2 displayed lower friction values than that displayed by shoe 1. At water wetted sliding, friction coefficient displayed by bare foot and foot wearing shoes presented lower values than that observed at dry sliding. The majority of the tested emery papers gave higher friction coefficient values than the reference one. Based on that observation, skateboarding could be dangerous using the reference emery paper and emery paper of 100 grit number can be recommended to provide the highest values of friction coefficient and the lowest slip.},

	abstract = {Purpose: 
        To investigate whether the difference in jump height between countermovement jumps (CMJ) and squat jumps (SJ) could be explained by a difference in active state during propulsion.
        Methods: 
        Simulations were performed with a model of the human musculoskeletal system comprising four body segments and six muscles. The model's only input was STIM, the stimulation of muscles, which could be switched “off” or “on.” After switching “on,” STIM increased to its maximum at a fixed rate of change (dSTIM/dt). For various values of dSTIM/dt, stimulation switch times were optimized to produce a maximum height CMJ. From this CMJ, the configuration at the lowest height of the center of gravity (CG) was selected and used as static starting configuration for simulation of SJ. Next, STIM-switch times were optimized to find the maximum height SJ.
        Results: 
        Simulated CMJ and SJ closely resembled jumps of human subjects. Maximum jump height of the model was greater in CMJ than in SJ, with the difference ranging from 0.4 cm at infinitely high dSTIM/dt to about 2.5 cm at the lowest dSTIM/dt investigated. The greater jump height in CMJ was due to a greater work output of the hip extensor muscles. These muscles could produce more force and work over the first 30\% of their shortening range in CMJ, due to the fact that they had a higher active state in CMJ than in SJ.
        Conclusion: 
        The greater jump height in CMJ than in SJ could be explained by the fact that in CMJ active state developed during the preparatory countermovement, whereas in SJ it inevitably developed during the propulsion phase, so that the muscles could produce more force and work during shortening in CMJ.},

Early efforts in humanoid research were dedicated to bipedal walking, ﬁrst on ﬂat terrains and recently on uneven ones, while the manipulation capabilities inherit from the literature in bimanual and dexteroushand manipulation. In practice, the two problems interact largely. Locomotion in cluttered spaces beneﬁts from extra contacts between any part of the robot and the environment, such as when grippers grasp a handrail during stair climbing, while legs can conversely enhance manipulation capabilities, such as when arching the whole body to augment contact pressure at an end effector. The two problems share the same background: they are governed by non-smooth dynamics (friction and impacts at contacts) under viability constraints including dynamic stability. Consequently, they are now solved jointly. This chapter highlights the state-of-the-art techniques used for this purpose in multi-contact planning and control.},

	abstract = {Musculoskeletal simulations are used in many different applications, ranging from the design of wearable robots that interact with humans to the analysis of patients with impaired movement. Here, we introduce OpenSim Moco, a software toolkit for optimizing the motion and control of musculoskeletal models built in the OpenSim modeling and simulation package. OpenSim Moco uses the direct collocation method, which is often faster and can handle more diverse problems than other methods for musculoskeletal simulation. Moco frees researchers from implementing direct collocation themselves—which typically requires extensive technical expertise—and allows them to focus on their scientific questions. The software can handle a wide range of problems that interest biomechanists, including motion tracking, motion prediction, parameter optimization, model fitting, electromyography-driven simulation, and device design. Moco is the first musculoskeletal direct collocation tool to handle kinematic constraints, which enable modeling of kinematic loops (e.g., cycling models) and complex anatomy (e.g., patellar motion). To show the abilities of Moco, we first solved for muscle activity that produced an observed walking motion while minimizing squared muscle excitations and knee joint loading. Next, we predicted how muscle weakness may cause deviations from a normal walking motion. Lastly, we predicted a squat-to-stand motion and optimized the stiffness of an assistive device placed at the knee. We designed Moco to be easy to use, customizable, and extensible, thereby accelerating the use of simulations to understand the movement of humans and other animals.},

	abstract = {To understand how intermuscular control, inertial interactions among body segments, and musculotendon dynamics coordinate human movement, we have chosen to study maximum-height jumping. Because this activity presents a relatively unambiguous performance criterion, it fits well into the framework of optimal control theory. The human body is modeled as a four-segment, planar, articulated linkage, with adjacent links joined together by frictionless revolutes. Driving the skeletal system are eight musculotendon actuators, each muscle modeled as a three-element, lumped-parameter entity, in series with tendon. Tendon is assumed to be elastic, and its properties are defined by a stress-strain curve. The mechanical behavior of muscle is described by a Hill-type contractile element, including both series and parallel elasticity. Driving the musculotendon model is a first-order representation of excitation-contraction (activation) dynamics. The optimal control problem is to maximize the height reached by the center of mass of the body subject to body-segmental, musculotendon, and activation dynamics, a zero vertical ground reaction force at lift-off, and constraints which limit the magnitude of the incoming neural control signals to lie between zero (no excitation) and one (full excitation). A computational solution to this problem was found on the basis of a Mayne-Polak dynamic optimization algorithm. Qualitative comparisons between the predictions of the model and previously reported experimental findings indicate that the model reproduces the major features of a maximum-height squat jump (i.e. limb-segmental angular displacements, vertical and horizontal ground reaction forces, sequence of muscular activity, overall jump height, and final lift-off time).},

The problem of maximizing the release velocity of the ball after impact is treated under the constraint of a specified weight of club head. The thickness distribution of the clubface is chosen as the design variable for optimization. The basis vector method, which is an approximating method for optimization problems in which the sensitivity cannot be derived analytically, is employed. The basis vector represents a fundamental change of shape, and it is preferable to obtaining effective results that the basis vectors be mutually independent. A simple approach to create the basis vectors using eigenmodes is also presented. The theory of impedance matching is confirmed numerically by a two-dimensional example. A three-dimensional example is given to show that this approach is effective for optimal design of the golf club head. Copyright © 2004 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

This letter presents a contact-implicit framework for trajectory optimization using direct collocation that combines an unplanned impulsive contact model with an implicit, high-order numerical integration scheme. We demonstrate that this framework can resolve problems that other implicit formulations cannot, namely elastic or partially elastic collisions, and impacts without collision – the established resolution of the Painlevé paradox. We then evaluate its applicability to legged robotics problems and test its ability to discover the intricate sequence of varied collision types necessary to execute a skateboarding trick.},

	abstract = {Optimal Control methods are increasingly used for the control of multibody systems (MBS). This work analyzes the different dynamic formulations and compare their performances in solving Optimal Control Problem. The focus is on minimal coordinates and the derivation of the dynamics via the recursive methods for treelike MBS (i.e., the so-called Newton-Euler and Order-N recursive algorithms). The different formulations are introduced and their derivations are discussed. A benchmark case study (i.e., a 3D series manipulator balancing an inverted pendulum) is modeled and a series of manipulation tasks (movement of the end effector in the 3D space) are performed. The OCP is formulated and solved with the help of the CasADi software while the dynamic formulations are generated by the Robotran software. Results show that the implicit and semi-explicit formulations derived via the Newton-Euler recursive algorithm lead to faster computation of the OCP than the explicit formulations. This is explained by a more compact expression for the implicit dynamics. However, a lower number of high local minima is observed with the explicit formulations for the most extreme robot manipulations.},

	abstract = {Brachiation is the primary form of locomotion for gibbons and siamangs, in which these primates swing from tree limb to tree limb using only their arms. It is challenging to control because of the limited control authority, the required advance planning, and the precision of the required grasps. We present a novel approach to this problem using reinforcement learning, and as demonstrated on a finger-less 14-link planar model that learns to brachiate across challenging handhold sequences. Key to our method is the use of a simplified model, a point mass with a virtual arm, for which we first learn a policy that can brachiate across handhold sequences with a prescribed order. This facilitates the learning of the policy for the full model, for which it provides guidance by providing an overall center-of-mass trajectory to imitate, as well as for the timing of the holds. Lastly, the simplified model can also readily be used for planning suitable sequences of handholds in a given environment. Our results demonstrate brachiation motions with a variety of durations for the flight and hold phases, as well as emergent extra back-and-forth swings when this proves useful. The system is evaluated with a variety of ablations. The method enables future work towards more general 3D brachiation, as well as using simplified model imitation in other settings.},

To ensure physically realizable bicycle designs we include 7 equality constraints, 21 inequality constraints, and lower and upper bounds on each free optimization parameter. This improves over the prior work by expanding the search space with many more parameters and the guarantee of physical realizability. We present four bicycle designs discovered by the optimization procedure that have optimal later handling qualities. The bicycles are similar in design to familiar bicycle designs but are not generally self-stable and exhibit unusual characteristics such as large positive and negative trail, large size relative to the rider, and minimal steering inertia. The method is a useful tool for generating atypical bicycle designs that exhibit desired dynamical qualities and could be broadly applied to other vehicle designs.},

	abstract = {Abstract
            The Durometer hardness test is one of the most commonly used measurements to qualitatively assess and compare the mechanical behavior of elastomeric and elastomeric-like materials. This paper presents nonlinear finite element simulations of hardness tests which act to provide a mapping of measured Durometer Shore A and D values to the stress-strain behavior of elastomers. In the simulations, the nonlinear stress-strain behavior of the elastomers is first represented using the Gaussian (neo-Hookean) constitutive model. The predictive capability of the simulations is verified by comparison of calculated conversions of Shore A to Shore D values with the guideline conversion chart in ASTM D2240. The simulation results are then used to determine the relationship between the neo-Hookean elastic modulus and Shore A and Shore D values.
            The simulation results show the elastomer to undergo locally large deformations during hardness testing. In order to assess the potential role of the limiting extensibility of the elastomer on the hardness measurement, simulations are conducted where the elastomer is represented by the non-Gaussian Arruda-Boyce constitutive model. The limiting extensibility is found to predict a higher hardness value for a material with a given initial modulus. This effect is pronounced as the limiting extensibility decreases to less than 5 and eliminates the one-to-one mapping of hardness to modulus. However, the durometer hardness test still can be used as a reasonable approximation of the initial neo-Hookean modulus unless the limiting extensibility is known to be small as is the case in many materials, such as some elastomers and most soft biological tissues.},

            A relation between British Standard and International rubber hardness and Young's modulus is derived from classical elasticity theory, and compared with the empirical relation given in B.S.903:1950. An experimental examination of the load-indentation relationship for a rigid sphere pressed into a flat rubber pad is described ; it indicates that the theoretical relation is more appropriate than the empirical one for small indentations, corresponding to hardnesses exceeding about 60° B.S. \& I.R.H., and equally valid for hardnesses between about 40° and 60°. Moreover, the numerical constants are not subject to experimental uncertainty. If reduced major loads are stipulated for determining the hardness of rubbers of less than 35° to 40° B.S. \& I.R.H., the theoretical relation should apply over the entire useful range. An approximate relation between Shore hardness and Young's modulus is derived similarly. The approximate equivalence of the British Standard and International rubber hardness and Shore hardness scales over the major part of the hardness range is confirmed.},

	abstract = {Objectives
Hardness of elastomers can be directly related to Young's modulus, a relationship that was investigated in detail by Gent in a paper in 1958. The aim of this study was to test this relationship for 13 dental elastomers (12 silicone and 1 polyether) using the equation derived by Gent and one from BS 903 (1950) that accounts for departures at low values.
Methods
The dental elastomers were subjected to tensile testing and Shore A scale hardness measurements. Young's moduli were calculated from the hardness values using the Gent equation and the BS 903 equation. These calculated values were then compared with values derived experimentally from the tensile tests.
Results
Hardness values were in the range 30.2 (±0.5)–62.9 (±0.8) with the corresponding calculated modulus values in the range 1.1–4.1MPa and 0.9–4.3MPa for the Gent and modified equations, respectively. Young's modulus values derived from the tensile data were in the range 0.8 (±0.3)–4.1 (±0.3)MPa, showing good agreement with those calculated from the hardness values. Providing viscoelastic creep is minimal during the duration of the test, there is a reasonably well-defined relationship between Shore hardness and Young's modulus in the hardness range studied.
Significance
Simple, non-destructive hardness measurements can be used to determine Young's modulus values. Such values are needed in any calculations of stress distributions in soft lining materials, e.g. by FEA.},

The contact formulation is based on the penalty method, where the classical Coulomb’s law is used considering a convected coordinate system for three-dimensional friction with large deformation and finite sliding.

Then, we will focus on modeling in contact mechanics, which will give the opportunity to discuss these issues in connection with non-smooth problems. It will be shown that the non-smooth character of the contact laws raises difficulties and specificities at every step of the modeling process. A wide overview will be given on the art of mod-eling in contact mechanics under its various aspects: contact laws, their mechanical basics, various scales, underlying concepts, mathematical analysis, solvers, identification of the constitutive parameters and validation of the models. Every point will be illustrated by one or several examples. 1 Modeling: the bases It would be ambitious to try to give a general definition of the concept either of a model itself or of model processing. Modeling relates to the general process of production of scientific knowledge and also to the scientific method itself. It could be deductive (from the general to the particular, as privileged by Aristotle) or inductive (making sense of a corpus of raw data). Descartes (38) saw in the scientific method an approach to be followed step by step to get to a truth. Modeling can be effectively regarded as a scientific method that proceeds step by step, but its objective is more modest: to give sense of an observation or an experiment, and above all to predict behaviors within the context of specific assumptions. This concept of " proceeding step by step " is fundamental in modeling. In this first section, we will examine the notion of model in the general context of mechanical systems.},

	abstract = {Impact tests using a pendulum were performed on the shod heel region of nine subjects. Both soft- and hard-soled shoes were used. The deformations involved were calculated from the registered decelerations during impact. Thus, load-deformation cycles were recorded for various impact velocities. In contrast to in vivo force-platform recordings, peak loadings for the soft- and hard-soled conditions differed significantly (614 +/- 29 N vs 864 +/- 49 N, respectively), thus challenging the evidence for compensation at the level of the heel pad. Moreover, computation of the compression of the heel pad in the shoe showed an unexpected inverse relationship between shoe midsole hardness and degree of heel pad compression: the harder the midsole, the smaller the compression (soft shoe 7.6 +/- 0.9 mm; hard shoe 6.7 +/- 0.9 mm). This can be explained by assuming a loading rate dependent stiffness of the heel pad in the shod condition (stiffness in N.m-1 = 51.25x (loading rate in N.s-1)0.76; R2 = 0.90), determined by the visco-elastic nature of the heel pad and the spatial confinement of the heel counter of the shoe.},

When applied to dynamic musculoskeletal models such optimality principles might be used to predict how a patient's gait adapts to mechanical interventions such as prosthetic devices or surgery. In this paper we study the effects of different performance criteria on predicted gait patterns using a 2D musculoskeletal model. The associated optimal control problem for a family of different cost functions was solved utilizing the direct collocation method. It was found that fatigue-like cost functions produced realistic gait, with stance phase knee flexion, as opposed to energy-related cost functions which avoided knee flexion during the stance phase. We conclude that fatigue minimization may be one of the primary optimality principles governing human gait.},

A total of approximately 1.5 h of normal walking ({\textgreater}5000 gait cycles) and 6 h of perturbed walking ({\textgreater}20,000 gait cycles) is included in the data set.

In particular, various con-tact force models from linear to nonlinear, purely elastic to dissipative con-tact force models are presented and their parameters are described. The different numerical methods and algorithms dealing with contact problems in multibody systems are presented and discussed. In present work, the gross motion of multibody systems is described by using a two-dimensional formulation based on the absolute coordinates and the contact-impact events are represented by different contact models. Results for some planar multi-body mechanical systems are presented and utilized to discuss the main assumptions and procedures adopted throughout this work. The material provided here indicates that the prediction of the dynamic behavior of mechanical systems involving contact-impact strongly depends on the selection of the contact force model. Overall, this book is aimed to provide a collective source for the multibody dynamics community and beyond on modeling contact forces and dynamics of mechanical systems undergoing contact-impact events.},

Throughout the paper we illustrate each new set of concepts by working through a sequence of four example problems. We start by using trapezoidal collocation to solve a simple one-dimensional toy problem and work up to using Hermite--Simpson collocation to compute the optimal gait for a bipedal walking robot. Along the way, we cover basic debugging strategies and guidelines for posing well-behaved optimization problems. The paper concludes with a short overview of other methods for trajectory optimization. We also provide an electronic supplement that contains well-documented MATLAB code for all examples and methods presented. Our primary goal is to provide the reader with the resources necessary to understand and successfully implement their own direct collocation methods. (An erratum is attached.)},

	abstract = {Trajectory optimization is the process of designing a trajectory that minimizes (or maximizes) some measure of performance while satisfying a set of constraints. Generally speaking, trajectory optimization is a technique for computing an open-loop solution to an optimal control problem. It is often used for systems where computing the full closed-loop solution is not required, impractical or impossible.  If a trajectory optimization problem can be solved at a rate given by the inverse of the Lipschitz constant, then it can be used iteratively to generate a closed-loop solution in the sense of Caratheodory.  If only the first step of the trajectory is executed for an infinite-horizon problem, then this is known as Model Predictive Control (MPC).
Although the idea of trajectory optimization has been around for hundreds of years (calculus of variations, brachystochrone problem), it only became practical for real-world problems with the advent of the computer. Many of the original applications of trajectory optimization were in the aerospace industry, computing rocket and missile launch trajectories. More recently, trajectory optimization has also been used in a wide variety of industrial process and robotics applications.},

	abstract = {Purpose: This study aimed to further the knowledge on gaze behavior in locomotion by studying gaze strategies in skateboard jumps of different difficulty that had to be performed either with or without an obstacle. Method: Nine experienced skateboarders performed "Ollie" and "Kickflip" jumps either over an obstacle or over a plane surface. The stable gaze at 5 different areas of interest was calculated regarding its relative duration as well as its temporal order. Results: During the approach phase, an interaction between area of interest and obstacle condition, F(3, 24) = 12.91, p{\textless}.05, eta(2)(p) =.62, was found with longer stable-gaze locations at the takeoff area in attempts with an obstacle (p,.05, hp 2 =.47). In contrast, in attempts over a plane surface, longer stable-gaze locations at the skateboard were revealed (p{\textless}.05, eta(2)(p) =.73). Regarding the trick difficulty factor, the skateboarders descriptively showed longer stable-gaze locations at the skateboard for the " Kickflip" than for the "Ollie" in the no-obstacle condition only (p{\textless}.05, d = 0.74). Finally, during the jump phase, neither obstacle condition nor trick difficulty affected gaze behavior differentially. Conclusions: This study underlines the functional adaptability of the visuomotor system to changing demands in highly dynamic situations. As a function of certain constraints, different gaze strategies were observed that can be considered as highly relevant for successfully performing skateboard jumps.},

A more complicated two-degree-of-freedom vehicle model, including independent roll of both the board and of the rider, is also derived and is shown to have the possibility of speed stabilization as well.

Its dynamics are augmented by those of the skateboard and rider to describe the complete system in the tracking mode. Several control schemes are discussed. Under certain conditions, simple proportional feedback control of rider tilt angle can stabilize roll motion of the vehicle, but in the most general case full state feedback is required. In the complete state feedback case, a performance index for the tracking task is defined and the minimizing feedback gains determined.

	abstract = {Purpose. Despite concerns elicited by the injury-rate statistics for skateboarding, the literature has been silent on biomechanical factors that might be causing or exacerbating these injuries. To help fill this void, we sought to describe the kinetic characteristics of landing from a rail slide, one of the more high-risk, albeit common, maneuvers practiced by skateboarders. Methods. Twelve top-amateur or professional skateboarders (BW = 688 +/- 89 N) performed rail slide maneuvers down a steep handrail before landing on a force plate. We recorded ground reaction force (GRF) data whether the subjects landed successfully (L) on their skateboards, or, bailed-out (BO), i.e. landed on their feet. Results. Vertical GRF (VGRF) during L had an initial peak, due to skateboard contact, immediately followed by a set of impact peaks (mean = 7.98 +/- 1.32 (SD) BW) representing landing on the board. BO showed a VGRF impact peak rising to a significantly higher (P{\textless}0.05) mean of 12.09 +/- 2.63 BW. Conclusions. These data suggest that the skateboard provides significant shock attenuation. However, because BO landings are frequent, the relatively high peak ground reaction forces are a cause for concern. Given the musculoskeletal immaturity of typical skateboarders, clinicians should be aware of these high impact forces, and footwear manufacturers should explore ways to reduce peak pressures, and high impact and shear forces in the heel, forefoot, and toe box.},

In scientific literature we can find a lack of scientifically proved knowledge that describes the difference in muscular activity on various levels of this jump performance. Objective: The aim of this study was to characterize muscular activity in the basic skateboard Ollie jump and to compare this activity with a more difficult modification of the switchstance Ollie jump (the same jump but changed position of limbs). Methods: Ten men experienced in skateboarding for several years, aged 20.0 +/- 4.6 years participated in the study (height 1.79 +/- 0.05 m, body mass 71.5 +/- 4.1 kg). All subjects performed 3 measured Ollie jumps and after that 3 switchstance Ollie jumps. In case of the last-mentioned front and back lower limbs are switched. The observation of muscular activity was carried out by the Delsys Trigno electromyography system. The jump was divided (after video records) into four phases: preparatory, take-off, flight-up and landing. Mean amplitude of muscle activity was measured in following muscles: tibialis anterior, gastrocnemius medialis, rectus femoris, semitendinosus and gluteus medius. Comparison of muscle activity during Ollie and switchstance Ollie was performed by the Wilcoxon test in Statistica. Results: Significantly greater activity (p {\textless}.05) was shown by gastrocnemius medialis and rectus femoris on the lower back limb during the preparatory phase of switchstance Ollie and by tibialis anterior and semitendinosus on lower front limb during the landing phase of Ollie. Conclusion: Results of our study suggest that in switchstance Ollie is increased muscle activity during preparation period on the back limb and movement control during landing. The skaters in this type of jump should move his/her centre of gravity from the tail to the centre of the skateboard and also he/she would produce adequate muscle activity also during the landing phase.},

As research dealing with AF is broad and diverse, the purpose of this review is to provide the reader with an overview of the use of AF in exercise, motor learning and injury prevention research with respect to how it can be presented, its informational content and the limitations. The term ‘augmented’ feedback is used because additional information provided by an external source is added to the task-intrinsic feedback that originates from a person's sensory system. In recent decades, numerous studies from various fields within sport science (exercise science, sports medicine, motor control and learning, psychology etc.) have investigated the potential influence of AF on performance improvements. The first part of the review gives a theoretical background on feedback in general but particularly AF. The second part tries to highlight the differences between feedback that is given as knowledge of result and knowledge of performance. The third part introduces studies which have applied AF in exercise and prevention settings. Finally, the limitations of feedback research and the possible reasons for the diverging findings are discussed. The focus of this review lies mainly on the positive influence of AF on motor performance. Underlying neuronal adaptations and theoretical assumptions from learning theories are addressed briefly.},

Six male participants were analyzed. Thirty-four reflective markers were placed on the skateboarder's body and four reflective markers on the board. The tridimensional analysis was captured by eleven cameras (100 Hz) (Vicon (R) system). The analysis of the ollie skateboard maneuver was performed in two different ways: a) without (static maneuver) and b) with (dynamic maneuver) a previous row. The joint angles (ankle, knee and hip), during maximal height center of mass of participants and the skateboard, were compared using the Student's T-test. The correlation between the center of mass of the participant and the skateboard was calculated using the Pearson Correlation. No significant differences were observed in the maximum height of the joint angles and centers of mass of the participants and the skateboard. The maximal height of the participant's and the skateboard's center of mass did not present a significant correlation. The results showed that there is no difference between performing the ollie skateboard maneuver with (static) or without (dynamic) a previous row. However, training to increase the height and improve the performance of the maneuver in general is essential for the skateboarder to achieve a higher score and a greater likelihood of success in sports competitions.},

We investigated how a skateboarder can accelerate from rest on a horizontal surface without touching an external support. The focus was laid on a tic-tac, which is a repeated turning of the whole body and the skateboard from one side to the other. We based our investigation on papers examining the acceleration in slalom skateboarding. We performed video analyses to give a qualitative explanation and gathered quantitative data on the motion of the skateboarder using an inertial measurement unit. It was shown that an important feature of a tic-tac is that the pivot in the rotation is not in the middle of the rear truck. This makes acceleration possible even if the deck is not tilted. With the mathematical analysis we put forward, we could calculate the effects of the controlling motions the skateboarder performs on the velocity of the skateboard as a system with non-holonomic constraints. Subsequently, we show that the calculations are in general agreement with our experimental data. Previous assumptions for the frictional forces were revised and we suggest a more accurate method to measure the wheel angle through the tilt of the deck.},

Skateboarders use video in a number of ways that significantly impact their learning and integration into their communities. They use it to analyze tricks and techniques, to document the stages of their learning and socialization into the group, to set community standards, to build a sense of belonging with their 'crews' and to imagine 'idealized futures' for themselves and their communities. Understanding the value and function of such 'semiotic mediation' in learning and socialization into sport cultures, I suggest, can contribute to helping physical educators design tasks that integrate training in physical skills with opportunities for students to make meaning around their experiences of sport and physical education.},

Characterization of heart rate responses, duration, and distances traveled in youth participating in recreational skateboarding at community skateparks. J Strength Cond Res 35(2): 542-548, 2021-Recreational skateboarding continues to gain popularity in youth within the United States and abroad. Surprisingly, there is a paucity of research regarding the cardiovascular responses of youth participating in recreational skateboarding. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to test the hypothesis that skateboarding would elicit heart rates and durations consistent with the American College of Sports Medicine (ACSM) and Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommendations for cardiovascular fitness in youth. Seventy-one recreational skateboarders (boys: 63 and girls: 8) between the ages of 6 and 17 years participated in this study. Data were acquired at 9 skateparks in the local community. After parental consent, subjects completed a questionnaire and were instrumented with a heart rate monitor (Polar V800 GPS Sports Watch), which recorded heart rate, duration, and distance traveled. Subjects were instructed to engage in typical skateboarding activities, with the duration and intensity of activity determined by the individual. Subjects were 10.6 +/- 2.9 years old and had participated in skateboarding for 3.1 +/- 2.4 years. On average, subjects skateboarded 55.5 +/- 28.4 minutes, at an average heart rate of 140.4 +/- 16.1 b center dot min(-1), and traveled an average distance of 2.65 +/- 1.87 km. Results from this study suggest that youth participating in recreational skateboarding at community skateparks attain exercise intensities and durations that are comparable with the ACSM's and CDC's exercise recommendations for cardiovascular fitness in youth. These findings may hold implications for city planners considering the impact of community skateparks on physical activity in youth and overall public health.},

The vertical GRF (VGRF) during the OU has a characteristic propulsive peak (M = 2.22 body weight [BW] +/- 0.22) resulting from rapidly rotating the tail of the board into the ground to propel the skater and board up and forward. The anterior-posterior (A-P) GRF also shows a pronounced peak (M = 0.05 +/- 0.01 BW) corresponding with this propulsive VGRF peak. The initial phase of landing in the OD shows an impact peak in VGRF rising during the first 30 to 80 ms to a mean of 4.74 +/- 0.46 BW. These impact peaks are higher than expected given the relatively short drop of 45.7 cm and crouched body position. But we observed that our participants intentionally affected a firm landing to stabilize the landing position; and the Ollie off the platform raised the center of mass, also contributing to higher forces.},

	abstract = {Learning physical activities such as sports and games is expensive and time-consuming. A common advice is "repetition makes perfection,"which implies that wrong actions must soon be noticed and avoided. A knowledgeable tutor is often required to provide good feedback for that purpose. However, this facility is available only for those who can afford tutorial fees and time arrangements must be made well in advance. Books and videos are often treated as a more affordable media for learning. However, books and videos show a two dimension picture, while the audience might like to see how a particular move is performed from another angle. Quite often, books and videos do not show the picture that its audience would like to visualize. For example, one skateboarding trick is actually best viewed from the back in order to clearly show how it is done; however, most two dimension pictures show the trick from the front where the result of the trick is nicely shown. A computer software application allows a user to see an object through a three dimensional experience by rotating the object. We adopt this technique to introduce a 3D medium that allows its user to view how skateboarding tricks are done. Specifically, we implement a 3D simulation software application that teaches the fundamental skills involved in street skateboarding. The software provides a high degree of interactivity by allowing users to view a single animated object from different camera angles. A user can interact with the software through a few easy-to-understand buttons in order to view the picture from other angles. User test results show that using the software is a more effective means to learn skateboarding compared to watching a video demonstration. A further benefit of this 3D simulation approach is that it facilitates faster video development time by allowing the use of reusable modules for similar movement patterns. Hence the 3D simulation application could be used to learn other sports and games, since most of them show a repeated hand-stroke, leg movement, or jumping posture. The approach discussed in this paper opens a venue to learn sports and games in a more interactive, efficient, and cost-effective way.},

	abstract = {In gymnastics, mainstream handstand coaching emphasizes developing an aligned rigid body configuration, frequently leaving wrist-controlled balance work to implicit learning. However, skill-related motor behavioral research suggests the wrists to primarily contribute postural control in handstands. Considering recent research on handstands revealing experience-dependent motor behavior, the present study aimed to examine motor learning effects of explicit wrist usage coaching on handstand performances in skilled and less skilled novices. Therefore, twenty-five volunteering sport students served as participants completing a three-week training intervention which solely and explicitly addressed successful wrist usage during handstand. A video-tutorial introducing participants to the wrist strategy of hand balance preceded five practical training sessions that all neglected providing explicit postural advice. Participants performed three handstands on a plane gymnastics mat prior to (pre-test) and after (post-test) completing the training intervention. Standardized video recordings of each trial allowed retrospective group assignment (skilled and less skilled novices) based on pre-test mean balance times. With this, balance times, expert assessments (postural execution and balance control strategies) and goniometric analyses of shoulder and hip joint angles served to detect practical changes in handstand performances. Enhanced balance times as well as increased scores for postural execution and balance control strategies were revealed for less skilled novices (p {\textless} .05), but not for skilled novices (p {\textgreater} .05). Furthermore, in both groups changes in shoulder and hip joint angles failed significance. In conclusion, present findings suggest practitioners to make entirely unexperienced handstand learners explicitly aware of the wrist strategy's operating principle.},

Tactile-verbal feedback and visual-comparative feedback effect several issues of motor learning in different manners; however, this is true even in a short-term approach.

	abstract = {Purpose
Different approaches like providing augmented feedback (aF), applying an external focus of attention (EF), or rewarding participants with money (RE) have been shown to instantly enhance motor performance. So far, these approaches have been tested either in separate studies or directly against each other. However, there is no study that combined aF, EF, and/or RE to test whether this provokes additional benefits. The aim of the present study was therefore to identify the most powerful combination.

Methods
Eighteen participants performed maximal countermovement jumps in six different conditions: neutral (NE), aF, RE, aF + EF, aF + RE, and aF + EF + RE.

Results
Participants demonstrated the highest jump heights with aF + EF, followed by aF + EF + RE, aF + RE, aF, RE, and finally, NE. Activity of the M. rectus femoris differed significantly between conditions resulting in lower muscular activity in aF + EF and aF + EF + RE compared with NE. All other parameters, such as ground reaction forces and joint angles, were comparable across conditions.

Conclusions
This is the first study showing superior performance when combining aF with EF. As reduced muscular activity was found only in conditions with EF, it is argued in line with the constrained action hypothesis that adopting an EF improves movement efficiency. In contrast, aF seems to rather enhance (intrinsic) motivation. However, monetary reward did not further amplify performance.},

The provision of KR significantly increased peak force (p = 0.046, 1.83\%), mean force (p = 0.037, 1.45\%), peak velocity (p {\textless} 0.001, 3.71\%), mean velocity (p = 0.004, 3.44\%), peak power (p {\textless} 0.001, 4.22\%) and mean power (p = 0.001, 4.69\%). A high within-session reliability was observed for all variables (coefficient of variation [CV] ≤ 5.62\%, intraclass correlation coefficient [ICC] ≥ 0.95). No systematic differences in reliability were detected between the jumps performed without KR (CV = 3.00 ± 1.38\%, ICC = 0.97 ± 0.03) and with KR (CV = 3.04 ± 1.49\%, ICC = 0.97 ± 0.04).

Moreover, it could generate new behavior patterns and could establish student-instructor trust as a medium of movement during lessons.},

	abstract = {The rules on how the rings exercises in male gymnastics are composed, rely on different body movements based on controlled alternation between the dynamic and isomefric muscular contraction. The main factors that determine the accuracy of executions in male artistic gymnastics rings are the balance control, the quality of processes that coordinate muscle activity, and the level of relative muscle strength. Specific training involves muscle and joint efforts of maximum intensity. The objective of this study was to design a training methodology that would allow effort volume and intensity to be adjusted according to individual features, and in the same time, to be able to avoid maximum intensity demands. The methodology we proposed has been developed and applied in laboratory conditions, based on a Force Control System, in isomefric contraction conditions, consisting of a hardware and a software component. This system ensures both controlled effort dosing and pausing between repetitions, as well as the subject's performance in terms of force variations and training task viewing on a monitor, in real time, under a graphical representation. The system provides information on the athlete's execution in real time, with a precision of 1 ms, and displays the information to the athlete in a graphical form every 10 ms. The study has been conducted in Bio-mofricity laboratory of the National Institute for Sport Science with the participation of six elite gymnasts. The progress gained by athletes after following the application of this methodology demonstrates the benefits of the use of the technology, allowing accurate measurement of the effort and providing real-time information on the quality of sports performance.},

	abstract = {Background: Much of the existing research concerning the use of video feedback (VFB) to enhance motor learning has been undertaken under strictly controlled experimental conditions. Few studies have sought to explore the impact of VFB on the skill learning experience of the students in a structured, school-based physical education (PE) setting. Most of those studies have only used qualitative approaches to implicate the potential value of VFB to enhance skill acquisition, students' engagement or self-assessment ability. Using a quantitative approach, the aim of this study was to investigate effects of using VFB on motor skill acquisition, self-assessment ability and motivation in a school-based learning environment (structured PE programme) with novice children learning a gymnastic skill. Method: Two French classes of beginners took part in a typical five-week learning programme in gymnastics. During each of the five, weekly lessons participants carried out the same warm-up routine and exercises. The experimental group (10 girls - 8 boys, 12.4 +/- 0.5 years) received VFB intermittently when learning a front handstand to flat back landing. VFB was given after every five attempts, combined with self-assessment and verbal instructions from the teacher. The control group (12 girls - 13 boys, 12.6 +/- 0.4 years) received exactly the same training but was not given VFB. In order to assess progress in motor skills, the arm-trunk angle (hand-shoulder-hip) was measured in the sagittal plane just as the hips formed a vertical line with the shoulders. Motivation was assessed using the Situational Motivation Scale questionnaire (Guay, F., R. J. Vallerand, and C. Blanchard. 2000. "On the Assessment of Situational Intrinsic and Extrinsic Motivation: The Situational Motivation Scale (SIMS)." Motivation and Emotion 24 (3): 175-213), and self-assessment ability was measured by self-perception task scores. Results: Statistical analysis of arm-trunk angle values showed significant differences only for the VFB group between the fifth lesson and all other lessons. Between lessons 4 and 5, the arm-trunk angle value increased significantly from 146.6 +/- 16.9 degrees to 161.2 +/- 14.2 degrees (p {\textless} .001; ES = 0.94). Self-assessment scores improved significantly for the VFB group between lesson 1 and lesson 2 (p {\textless} 0.01, ES = 1.79) and between lesson 4 to lesson 5 (p {\textless} .01, ES = 0.94). Amotivation decreased significantly for the VFB group between lesson 1 and lesson 5 (3.06 +/- 1.42 vs. 2.12 +/- 0.62, p {\textless} .001, ES = -0.89). Discussion/conclusion: Our quantitative data, identifying key movement changes as a function of experience in a structured PE programme, were congruent with outcomes of previous qualitative research supporting the role of VFB. This study highlights the potential relevance of using VFB in fostering motor learning, motivation and self-assessment during a PE programme with young children. Future pedagogical research is needed to examine the ways students could use VFB technology for greater self-regulation, with the potential to deliver appropriate movement feedback, based on different levels of experience in students.},

	abstract = {The transition from traditional to modern materials has had a significant effect on equipment performance in many sports. As a result, governing bodies are increasingly placing performance limits on equipment and so other characteristics are becoming important to players seeking the most desirable equipment for their game. The 'feel' of the equipment is one such subjective characteristic, which has also been significantly affected by changes in material, but it is difficult to define. Tactile and auditory sensations from impact have been found to contribute to the feel of a shot in several sports and this paper provides further evidence of this relationship. Using golf as an example, this study presents a method for measuring and analysing players' subjective perceptions. The results are then correlated with measurements of sound, linear vibration, and torsional vibration from impact. Stronger relationships were found with the sound data rather than the vibration data, suggesting that the sound is the most significant form of feedback from impact. Psychoacoustic metrics for assessing sound quality are discussed, including perceived loudness and sharpness. Relationships were found between these metrics and the players' perceptions although similar correlations were also found with traditional metrics, such as sound pressure level. The limitations of the psychoacoustic models for impulsive sounds are also discussed.},

	abstract = {Anticipation-coincidence tasks have been widely studied in order to better understand the coupling between perceptual information and motor action. Based on Lee's (1976) original time-to-contact theory the present study analysed the temporal control of golf putting. Though the conventional tau theory had difficulties in accounting for the visual control of accelerating movement, it was suggested here that the temporal control of impact can be achieved on the basis of an optical variable: tau(departure). The time from departure control hypothesis suggests that the starting position rather than the final position, plays a crucial role in the on-line visual control of golf putting. In order to test the tau(departure) hypothesis, a kinematic analysis of downswing was carried out when vision of the club was either allowed or occluded during movement execution. Results agreed quite well with the theoretical predictions and it was concluded that the time from departure control strategy might account for visually guided accelerating movements in golf putting and other striking skills.},

Participants (19 men and 15 women) putted a golf ball, stopping the ball on a line at a distance of 3.5 m from the starting position, which included an uphill portion. After a pretest, participants were assigned as they arrived in balanced order by sex to one of two groups (100\% KR, 33\% KR) and practiced 60 trials. Those in the 100\% KR group performed the task in its natural context, while others assigned to the 33\% KR were shown the location of the putted hall after every third trial. All participants then performed a posttest and two retention tests, done 10 min. and 24 hr. after the posttest. Analysis at postrest showed each group had a constant error and an absolute constant error (vertical bar CE vertical bar) less than those at pretest. Also, in the retention test conducted the following day, the constant error of the 33\% KR group was less than that of the 100\% KR group. Third, in the posttest and both retention tests, the ICEI of the 100\% KR group was larger than that of the 33\% KR group. These results suggest that reduced relative frequency of knowledge of results is effective in learning the accuracy of the golf putt.},

AHV was calculated in real time, and liquid crystal goggles were used to manipulate vision. Two gymnastics judges scored landing stability using a four-point scale. All vision conditions that allowed some vision yielded significantly better landing scores than in the NV condition. Furthermore, a nonparametric test revealed that VBelow yielded a better performance ranking than the FV condition. We conclude that visual feedback during a back tuck somersault is used for landing stability at all angular head velocities, but optimal feedback use occurs when there is retinal stability.},

A putting robot and a high-speed camera were used to simultaneously collect data for the validity evaluation. The TOMI (R) device, when used in conjunction with standard 3D coordinate data processing techniques, was found to be a valid and reliable method for measuring face angle, stroke path, putter speed, and impact spot at the moment of ball contact. The validity of the TOMI (R) measurement system was quantified using the 95\% limits of agreement method for each aforementioned variable. The practical significance of each validity score was assessed by incorporating the maximum estimated measurement error into the stroke of the putting robot for 10 consecutive putts. All putts were executed from a distance of 4m on a straight and flat synthetic putting surface. Since all putts were holed successfully, the measurement error for each variable was deemed to be negligible for the purposes of measuring putting stroke kinematics. The influence of key kinematic errors, at impact, on the outcome of a putt was also determined.},

Twenty-four players hit drives into a net with clubs of different shaft flexes. This was repeated with vibration applied. Club kinematics were stable across flex conditions with no vibration, and it is probable that players varied the application of torques during the downswing to compensate for changes in club mechanics. With vibration, for eleven players, club head speed and grip speed at impact increased with flex. This suggests these players could not apply desired torques, perhaps due to noise in proprioceptive feedback caused by vibration. (C) 2009 Published by Elsevier Ltd.},

We posit that the reality tool is essential in the future exergame learning system due to its virtual reality impact on a player's feeling.

	abstract = {It is unclear how the variability of kinematic errors experienced during motor training affects skill retention and motivation. We used force fields produced by a haptic robot to modulate the kinematic errors of 30 healthy adults during a period of practice in a virtual simulation of golf putting. On day 1, participants became relatively skilled at putting to a near and far target by first practicing without force fields. On day 2, they warmed up at the task without force fields, then practiced with force fields that either reduced or augmented their kinematic errors and were finally assessed without the force fields active. On day 3, they returned for a long-term assessment, again without force fields. A control group practiced without force fields. We quantified motor skill as the variability in impact velocity at which participants putted the ball. We quantified motivation using a self-reported, standardized scale. Only individuals who were initially less skilled benefited from training; for these people, practicing with reduced kinematic variability improved skill more than practicing in the control condition. This reduced kinematic variability also improved self-reports of competence and satisfaction. Practice with increased kinematic variability worsened these self-reports as well as enjoyment. These negative motivational effects persisted on day 3 in a way that was uncorrelated with actual skill. In summary, robotically reducing kinematic errors in a golf putting training session improved putting skill more for less skilled putters. Robotically increasing kinematic errors had no performance effect, but decreased motivation in a persistent way.},

Fourteen participants practiced balancing on one leg on a board that could freely rotate in the frontal plane. They performed six, 16-s trials standing on one leg on a stable surface (2 trials without manipulation, 2 with vestibular, and 2 with visual stimulation) and six trials on the balance board before and after a 30-min training. Center of mass (COM) movement, segment, and total angular momenta and board angles were determined. Trials on stable surface were compared with trials after training to assess effects of surface conditions. Trials pretraining and posttraining were compared to assess rapid (between trials pretraining) and slower (before and after training) learning, and sensory manipulation trials were compared with unperturbed trials to assess sensory weighting. COM excursions were larger on the unstable surface but decreased with practice, with the largest improvement over the pretraining trials. Changes in angular momentum contributed more to COM acceleration on the balance board, but with practice this decreased. Visual stimulation increased sway similarly in both surface conditions, while vestibular stimulation increased sway less on the balance board. With practice, the effects of visual and vestibular stimulation increased rapidly. Initially, oscillations of the balance board occurred at 3.5 Hz, which decreased with practice. The initial decrease in sway with practice was associated with upweighting of visual information, while later changes were associated with suppression of oscillations that we suggest are due to too high proprioceptive feedback gains.},

	abstract = {Objectives: To examine the influence of enhanced expectancies on motor learning, we manipulated learners' expectancies by providing criteria for "success" that were relatively easy or difficult to meet. Design: Experimental design with two groups. Method: Two groups of non-golfers practiced putting golf balls to a target from a distance of 150 cm. The target was surrounded by a large (14 cm diameter) and a small circle (7 cm diameter) during practice. The groups were informed that balls coming to rest in the large circle (large-circle group) or small circle (small-circle group), respectively, constituted a "good" trial. One day later, the circles were removed. Participants putted from the same distance (retention) and a greater distance (transfer: 180 cm). Results: On both retention and transfer tests, accuracy was greater for the large-circle compared with the small-circle group. Conclusions: Enhancing expectancies by providing a relatively "easy" performance criterion led to more effective learning. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Performance errors drive motor learning for many tasks. The authors' aim was to determine which of two strategies, method of amplification of error (MAE) or direct instruction (DI), would be more beneficial for error correction during a full golfing swing with a driver. Thirty-four golfers were randomly assigned to one of three training conditions (MAE, DI, and control). Participants were tested in a practice session in which each golfer performed 7 pretraining trials, 6 training-intervention trials, and 7 posttraining trials; and a retention test after 1 week. An optoeletronic motion capture system was used to measure the kinematic parameters of each golfer's performance. Results showed that MAE is an effective strategy for correcting the technical errors leading to a rapid improvement in performance. These findings could have practical implications for sport psychology and physical education because, while practice is obviously necessary for improving learning, the efficacy of the learning process is essential in enhancing learners' motivation and sport enjoyment.},

	abstract = {In sensorimotor adaptation tasks, feedback delays can cause significant reductions in the rate of learning. This constraint is puzzling given that many skilled behaviors have inherently long delays (e.g., hitting a golf ball). One difference in these task domains is that adaptation is primarily driven by error-based feedback, whereas skilled performance may also rely to a large extent on outcome-based feedback. This difference suggests that error- and outcome-based feedback may engage different learning processes, and these processes may be associated with different temporal constraints. We tested this hypothesis in a visuomotor adaptation task. Error feedback was indicated by the terminal position of a cursor, while outcome feedback was indicated by points. In separate groups of participants, the two feedback signals were presented immediately at the end of the movement, after a delay, or with just the error feedback delayed. Participants learned to counter the rotation in a similar manner regardless of feedback delay. However, the aftereffect, an indicator of implicit motor adaptation, was attenuated with delayed error feedback, consistent with the hypothesis that a different learning process supports performance under delay. We tested this by employing a task that dissociates the contribution of explicit strategies and implicit adaptation. We find that explicit aiming strategies contribute to the majority of the learning curve, regardless of delay; however, implicit learning, measured over the course of learning and by aftereffects, was significantly attenuated with delayed error-based feedback. These experiments offer new insight into the temporal constraints associated with different motor learning processes.},

	abstract = {Background: Athletes have been shown to exhibit better balance compared to non-athletes (NON). However, few studies have investigated how the surface on which athletes train affects the strategies adopted to maintain balance. Two distinct athlete groups who experience different types of sport-specific balance training are stable surface athletes (SSA) such as basketball players and those who train on unstable surfaces (USA) such as surfers. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of training surface on dynamic balance in athletes compared to NON. Methods: Eight NON, eight SSA, and eight USA performed five 20-s trials in each of five experimental conditions including a static condition and four dynamic conditions in which the support surface translated in the anteroposterior (AP) or mediolateral (ML) planes using positive or negative feedback paradigms. Approximate entropy (ApEn) and root mean square distance (RMS) of the center of pressure (CoP) were calculated for the AP and ML directions. Four 3 x 5 (group x condition) repeated measures ANOVAs were used to determine significant effects of group and condition on variables of interest. Results: USA exhibited smaller ApEn values than SSA in the AP signals while no significant differences were observed in the ML CoP signals. Generally, the negative feedback conditions were associated with significantly greater RMS values than the positive feedback conditions. Conclusion: USA exhibit unique postural strategies compared to SSA. These unique strategies seemingly exhibit a direction-specific attribute and may be associated with divergent motor control strategies.

We estimate human motion from monocular video by recovering three-dimensional controllers capable of implicitly simulating the observed human behavior and replaying this behavior in other environments and under physical perturbations. Our approach employs a state-space biped controller with a balance feedback mechanism that encodes control as a sequence of simple control tasks. Transitions among these tasks are triggered on time and on proprioceptive events (e.g., contact). Inference takes the form of optimal control where we optimize a high-dimensional vector of control parameters and the structure of the controller based on an objective function that compares the resulting simulated motion with input observations. We illustrate our approach by automatically estimating controllers for a variety of motions directly from monocular video. We show that the estimation of controller structure through incremental optimization and refinement leads to controllers that are more stable and that better approximate the reference motion. We demonstrate our approach by capturing sequences of walking, jumping, and gymnastics.},

	abstract = {This paper describes an autonomous kinematic analysis platform for wrist angle measurement that is capable of evaluating a user's uncocking motion in his or her golf swing and providing instructional multimodal feedback to improve his or her skills. This uncocking motion, which is a characteristic movement of the wrist during the golf swing, is an important factor in achieving accurate ball hitting and long driving distances, but is difficult to measure. In order to efficiently compute the wrist angle for uncocking evaluation, we present a sensor-based intelligent Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) agent that collects three-dimensional orientation data during the golf swing from two IMU sensors placed on the forearm and on the golf club. It accurately analyzes changes in wrist angle to detect uncocking throughout the sequence of golf swing motions. In this paper, we first introduce the design considerations based on the concept of the uncocking motion and explain the system architecture with the sensors used for quantitative measurement and qualitative feedback generation. Then, we illustrate the detailed algorithms for wrist angle computation, golf swing motion segmentation based on key pose detection, and uncocking evaluation. A multimodal feedback-based user interface for our system is also presented. Experimental results show that the proposed system has the ability to accurately calculate the wrist angle in real time and also that it can be applied to a practical self-coaching system to improve the uncocking motion.},

In the present study, we examined whether practicing putting with small or large surrounding circles would have not only immediate effects on performance, but also longer-lasting effects on motor learning. Two groups of nongolfers practiced putting golf balls to a 10.4-cm circle ("hole") from a distance of 2 m. Small or large circles were projected around the hole during the practice phase. Perception of hole size was affected by the size of the surrounding circles. Also, self-efficacy was higher in the group with the perceived larger hole. One day after practice, participants performed the putting task, but without visual illusions (i.e., a retention test). Putting accuracy in retention was greater for the group that had practiced with the perceived larger hole. These findings suggest that the apparently larger target led to the more effective learning outcome.},

The primary purpose of the proposed system is to serve as a general tool in the research on impact of different feedback modalities on the process of motor learning, for example, in sports or rehabilitation. The key advantages of the system are high-speed and high-accuracy tracking, as well as its flexibility, as it supports various types of feedback (auditory and visual, concurrent or terminal).

Method: Sixty students were quasi-randomly assigned to four groups under a varying combination of the two factors of task difficulty control (self-controlled or yoked) and feedback control (self-controlled or yoked). The participants in the two groups (dual-factor gradual self-control and self-controlled task difficulty group) that granted control over task difficulty in the acquisition phase were told they could choose any of the pre-set distances from the target. All groups were given 100\% feedback in the first half of the acquisition phase, but the participants in the two groups (dual-factor gradual self-control group and self-controlled feedback) that could control their feedback were told that in the second half of the acquisition phase they would be able to ask for feedback when needed. The practice schedule of each member of the dual-factor gradual self-control group was used as a basis to plan the practice of predetermined distances and feedback presentation to the corresponding participants in the yoked conditions. Results: ANOVA with repeated measures showed that the practice method involving gradual self-control of two factors had a positive impact on accuracy and movement pattern of golf putting in the retention and transfer tests compared to other methods (p(s) {\textless} .05). Conclusion: The advantages of self-control practice presumably come from better adjustment of challenge points by the learner in the course of the practice.},

Forty-five physical education students were randomly assigned to three learning groups: (a) a large-circle group, (b) a small-circle group, and (c) a control group (no circle). They all performed 50 putts from a distance of 2m. We informed the participants in the large-circle and the small-circle groups that landing the golf ball inside the circle would be considered a successful trial. Two days later, the participants performed a retention test of 12 putts followed by a transfer test of 12 putts from 2.5m. The participants who putted with the larger circle around the hole showed a lower absolute error than the control participants in the acquisition putts. In addition, these participants showed a lower absolute error and an increased number of holed putts compared to the participants in the control group in the transfer test. The results suggest that placing a relatively large circle around a golf hole in practice can lead to improved putting performance.},

Results indicated that EEG theta power was maintained at an elevated level during the feedback period in the self-controlled group relative to the yoked group. The yoked group did not display increases in theta power until the time at which the ball stopped. Both groups displayed similar improvement over the course of the experiment. Correlational analyses revealed that performance improvement within each group was related differently to EEG theta power. Specifically, the self-controlled group displayed positive relationships between theta power and performance improvement, while the yoked group displayed negative relationships.

	abstract = {This study examined how providing different criteria for success affected perceived expectations of success, performance, and learning in a golf-putting task. Twenty-nine physical education students were divided into three experimental groups: (a) a large-circle (LC) group that practiced 10 blocks of five putts, each with a 40 cm diameter circle around the target; (b) a small circle (SC) group that practiced with a 10 cm diameter circle around the target; and (c) a control (C) group that practiced with a 25 cm diameter circle around the target. Forty-eight hours after practice, the participants performed a retention test and a transfer test with a 25 cm diameter circle. The transfer test included putting from a greater distance and from a different angle. Throughout the study, we asked the participants to tell us what they think their chances are to land 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 balls out of 5 possible balls in each block. There were four main findings: (a) the SC group had lower expectancies of success compared with the LC and C groups in acquisition; (b) there were no group differences in performance or learning among groups; (c) golf club kinematic parameters worsened in the transfer test; and (d) the LC group reduced their expectancies of success from the retention to the transfer test, but the expectancies of the SC and C groups remained the same. We conclude that changes in success criteria affect expectancies of success but do not affect actual putting performance or learning.},

	abstract = {Whole-body movements are performed daily, and humans must constantly take into account the inherent instability of a standing posture. At times these movements may be performed in risky environments and when facing different costs of failure. The aim of the study was to test the hypothesis that in upright stance participants continuously estimate both probability of failure and cost of failure such that their postural responses will be based on these estimates. We designed a snowboard riding simulation experiment where participants were asked to control the position of a moving snowboard within a snow track in a risky environment. Cost functions were provided by modifying the penalty of riding in the area adjacent to the snow track. Uncertainty was modified by changing the gain of postural responses while participants were standing on a rocker board. We demonstrated that participants continually evaluated the environmental cost function and compensated for additional risk with feedback-based postural changes, even when probability of failure was negligible. Results showed also that the participants' estimates of the probability of failure accounted for their own inherent instability. Moreover, participants showed a tendency to overweight large probabilities of failure with more biomechanically constrained standing postures that results in suboptimal estimates of risky environments. Overall, our results suggest that participants tune their standing postural responses by empirically estimating the cost of failure and the uncertainty level in order to minimize the risk of falling when cost is high.

The task consisted of feeling on an actuated surface and listening through headphones to the recorded feedback of a ping-pong ball hitting three flat objects respectively made of wood, plastic, and metal, and then identifying their material. In Experiment 1, sounds and vibrations were recorded by keeping the objects in mechanical isolation. In Experiment 2, recordings were taken while the same objects stood on a table, causing their resonances to fade faster due to mechanical coupling with the support. A control experiment, where participants listened to and touched the real objects in mechanical isolation, showed high accuracy of classification from either sounds (90\% correct) or vibrations (67\% correct). Classification of reproduced bounces in Experiments 1 and 2 was less precise. In both experiments, the main effect of material was statistically significant; conversely, the main effect of modality (auditory or tactile) was significant only in the control. Identification of plastic and especially metal was less accurate in Experiment 2, suggesting that participants, when possible, classified materials by longer resonance tails. Audiotactile summation of classification accuracy was found, suggesting that multisensory integration influences the perception of materials. Such results have prospective application to the nonvisual design of virtual buttons, which is the object of our current research.},

Notably, the authors suggest asking learners to choose when to receive feedback in order to increase autonomy. Conversely, the guidance hypothesis predicts an impact of feedback schedule independent of motivational influences. The purpose of this experiment was to compare the relative and combined effects of autonomy and feedback schedule for the acquisition of a golf putting task without vision of results. Autonomy support (autonomy support vs. yoked) and knowledge of results (KR) schedule (100\%-KR vs. 50\%-faded-KR) were combined in a 2 x 2 factorial design. Participants (N = 56) in the autonomy support groups were asked to choose from three colours of golf balls for each putt during 10 acquisition blocks. Yoked groups were yoked to the golf ball colour choices of their autonomy support group counterparts. Participants in the 100\%-feedback schedule groups were provided x- and y-coordinate KR following every putt during acquisition, while participants in the 50\%-faded groups received KR after half of their putts, with feedback frequency decreasing over acquisition blocks. All participants completed a 24-h delayed retention and transfer test without KR. The results were somewhat consistent with OPTIMAL Theory yet the effects were not statistically significant and trivially small. The results were inconsistent with the guidance hypothesis.},

	abstract = {With the rapid development of the information society, human body gesture recognition has become an important technology for human-computer interaction. This paper combines Kinect's human bone monitoring technology with auxiliary gymnastics training. The gymnastics and dance training can correct students' wrong movements in time through feedback and improve the training efficiency, so as to meet the needs of nature and harmony of human-machine interaction. In this paper, based on the wireless network Kinect, the human body posture recognition method and tracking technology are studied, and the joint point angle representation method based on the fixed axis is proposed, and the posture recognition method based on the joint point angle is improved, which can accurately recognize the human body posture. Aiming at the situation that the human joint points are occluded, the human joint point repair algorithm is improved. The algorithm is based on the proportion of human bone nodes and the characteristics of human motion, and based on geometric principles, it repairs the occluded points. The feasibility of the original joint point data, angle feature, and distance feature in expressing human behavior is analyzed through experiments, a standard gymnastics movement database is established, and new gymnastics movements can be entered at any time. A gymnastics auxiliary training system is designed, which can analyze and evaluate the exercises of the trainer from the joint point coordinates and the angle formed by the joints and provide the trainer with intuitive error correction prompts. The human body posture recognition method studied in this paper can accurately give the difference between the trainer's movement and the standard movement, and the trainer can adjust the movement posture according to the prompts, improve the level of gymnastics, and achieve the purpose of auxiliary training. Experiments show that the algorithm model has an accuracy rate of 95.7\% for human body posture recognition, and it plays a huge role in line dance aerobics and gymnastics training.},

	abstract = {Evidence that self-controlled feedback schedules are more effective for motor learning than yoked or predetermined schedules has been used to forward the recommendation that practitioners should provide choice to learners over when they would like to receive feedback. This recommendation can be questioned because the typical comparison groups in such experimentation do not well represent the applied setting. Consequently, comparison groups that better map onto the applied setting are needed. To this end, three groups learned a golf putting task: (1) self-controlled, (2) traditional-yoked, and (3) a group who were led to believe their KR schedule was being controlled by a golf coach. Participants (N = 60) completed a pre-test, acquisition phase, and delayed post-tests (retention/transfer). No group differences during the post-tests for mean radial error, F(2, 54) = 2.71, p = .075, or bivariate variable error, F(2, 56) = 0.11, p = .896, were found. Thus, the typical self-controlled learning advantage was not observed. Given the failure to replicate self-controlled benefits, combined with the fact there is little research that has directly compared self-controlled feedback schedules to coach-controlled schedules, we argue more evidence is needed before advocating that learners be provided choice over their feedback schedule.},

We recorded ground reaction force (GRF) data for three Ollie Up (OU) and Ollie Down (OD) trials per participant. The vertical GRF (VGRF) during the OU has a characteristic propulsive peak (M = 2.22 body weight [BW] ± 0.22) resulting from rapidly rotating the tail of the board into the ground to propel the skater and board up and forward. The anterior-posterior (A-P) GRF also shows a pronounced peak (M = 0.05 ± 0.01 BW) corresponding with this propulsive VGRF peak. The initial phase of landing in the OD shows an impact peak in VGRF rising during the first 30 to 80 ms to a mean of 4.74 ± 0.46 BW. These impact peaks are higher than expected given the relatively short drop of 45.7 cm and crouched body position. But we observed that our participants intentionally affected a firm landing to stabilize the landing position; and the Ollie off the platform raised the center of mass, also contributing to higher forces.},

This system has multiple plates with sensors fixed to the device that moves, tilts, or deflects via the individual's movements, body lean, or gestures to provide the desired hands-free control. The upper body movement or leaning to operate this hands-free user interface can be compared to the action needed to manipulate a joystick. This solves the problem of continuous attention to the operation of a machine such as a wheelchair via one or both hands. To assess the operation of this controller it has been added to a power wheelchair to replace the joystick.

Advances in design and manufacturing materials since the introduction of skateboarding in the 1960s have made skateboards more maneuverable, and speeds up to 40 mph can be obtained. Different styles of skateboarding have evolved over time and can be broadly divided into two different categories: skateboarding to perform tricks and skateboarding as a means of transportation. In parallel with the rise in popularity and the advances in materials, skateboarding injuries have increased, and the injury pattern can be expected to further increase with the development of riskier skateboard tricks. The understanding of skateboard-related injuries includes a basic knowledge skateboarding styles and tricks as well as an understanding of the age-related patterns of anatomic distribution and severity of injuries. Most commonly, skateboarders who fall suffer from scrapes, cuts, bruises, and sprains. However, many patients suffer significant injuries, including head injuries and long-bone fractures. The incidence and severity of head and extremity injuries are age dependent, increasing significantly in older age groups. Mandatory protective gear such as helmets and extremity protective devices should be considered.},

The goal was to examine the patterns and trends of skateboarding-related injuries sustained by children and adolescents in the United States.

Methods
A retrospective analysis was conducted using data from the National Electronic Injury Surveillance System for children and adolescents 5-19 years of age treated in emergency departments for injuries associated with skateboards from 1990 through 2008.

Results
An estimated 1 226 868 children/adolescents (95 \% CI: 948 733—1 505 003) were treated in emergency departments for skateboarding-related injuries from 1990 through 2008, an average of 64,572 cases per year. From 1990 through 1994, the annual rate of injuries per 10,000 children/adolescents significantly decreased overall and for males (overall: 72.9 \%, P = 0.014; males: 73.9 \%, P = 0.011; females: 63.6 \%, P = 0.062). From 1994 to 2008, annual rates of injuries per 10,000 children/adolescents significantly increased overall and for both males and females (overall: 378.9 \%, P {\textless} 0.001; males: 393.4 \%, P {\textless} 0.001; females: 283.3 \% P {\textless} 0.001). From 1990 to 1994 the annual rate of injuries per 10,000 children/adolescents significantly decreased for all age groups (5-10 years: 69.9 \%, P = 0.043; 11-14 years: 80.6 \%, P = 0.017; 15-19 years: 64.2 \%, P = 0.024), and then significantly increased from 1994 to 2008 (5-10 years: 164.5 \%, P {\textless} 0.001; 11-14 years: 587.0 \%, P {\textless} 0.001; 15-19 years: 407.9 \%, P {\textless} 0.001)., Most patients were male (89.0 \%), injured at home (37.3 \%) or in the street and/or highway (29.3 \%), and were not hospitalized (96.9 \%). Patients 11-14 years of age constituted 44.9 \% of cases. The most commonly injured body regions were the upper (44.1 \%) and lower (31.7 \%) extremities. Fractures and dislocations were the most common diagnoses (32.1 \%). Children/adolescents 11-14 years of age were hospitalized more often than younger or older children/adolescents. Lower extremity injuries increased with age, while face and head or neck injuries decreased with age.

Conclusions
Skateboarding continues to be an important source of injury for children and adolescents. Further research, using more rigorous study designs, is required develop a broad perspective of the incidence and determinants of injury, and to further identify risk factors and viable injury countermeasures while simultaneously promoting participation in skateboarding.},

	abstract = {BackgroundSkateboarding, roller skating, and scooter riding are popular recreational and sporting activities for children and adolescents but can be associated with skeletal injury. The purpose of this study is to describe the frequency and characteristics of fractures resulting from these activities.PurposeFractures from skateboarding, roller skating, and scooter riding compose a considerable proportion of pediatric musculoskeletal injuries.Study DesignCase series; Level of evidence, 4.MethodsDemographic data and injury characteristics were analyzed for all patients who presented to the pediatric fracture clinic of the level I trauma center from January 2001 to May 2002 after sustaining fractures due to skateboarding, roller skating, and scooter riding.ResultsAmong a total of 2371 fractures, the authors identified 325 fractures (13.7\%) that occurred during one of these activities. There were 187 patients (mean age, 13 years; 95\% male) who sustained 191 skateboard-related fractures, 64 patients (mean age, 10.8 years; 54\% male) who sustained 65 fractures while roller skating, and 66 patients (mean age, 9.7 years; 64\% male) who sustained 69 fractures while riding a scooter. The forearm was fractured most often, composing 48.2\% of skate-boarding fractures, 63.1\% of roller-skating fractures, and 50.7\% of fractures due to scooter riding. Of the forearm fractures, 94\% were located in the distal third. In the skateboarding group, 10 of 191 (5.2\%) fractures were open injuries of the forearm, compared to 6 of 2046 (0.3\%) fractures caused by other mechanisms of injury (significant odds ratio, 18.8).ConclusionsSkateboarding, roller-skating, and scooter-riding accidents result in a large proportion of pediatric fractures. An open fracture, especially of the forearm, was more likely to be caused by skateboarding than by other mechanisms of injury. Use of wrist and forearm protective equipment should be considered in all children who ride a skateboard.},

A total of six amateur skateboarders (20 +/- 7 years of age with at least 5.0 years of experience) executed five tricks for each type of trick repeatedly on a customized ORY skateboard (IMU sensor fused) on a cemented ground. From the IMU data, a total of six raw signals extracted. A total of two input image type, namely raw data (RAW) and Continous Wavelet Transform (CWT), as well as six transfer learning models from three different families along with grid-searched optimized SVM, were investigated towards its efficacy in classifying the skateboarding tricks. It was shown from the study that RAW and CWT input images on MobileNet, MobileNetV2 and ResNet101 transfer learning models demonstrated the best test accuracy at 100\% on the test dataset. Nonetheless, by evaluating the computational time amongst the best models, it was established that the CWT-MobileNet-Optimized SVM pipeline was found to be the best. It could be concluded that the proposed method is able to facilitate the judges as well as coaches in identifying skateboarding tricks execution.},

We measured overground speed and metabolic rate while 15 experienced longboarders traveled at their self-selected slow, typical and fast speeds. Mean longboarding speeds were 3.7, 4.5 and 5.1 m s(-1), during slow, typical and fast trials, respectively. Mean rates of oxygen consumption were 24.1, 29.1 and 37.2 ml kg(-1) min(-1) and mean rates of energy expenditure were 33.5, 41.8 and 52.7 kJ min(-1) at the slow, typical and fast speeds, respectively. At typical speeds, average intensity was similar to 8.5 METs. There was a significant positive relationship between oxygen consumption and energy expenditure versus speed (R (2) = 0.69 (P {\textless} 0.001), and R (2) = 0.78 (P {\textless} 0.001), respectively). The gross metabolic cost was similar to 2.2 J kg(-1) m(-1) at the typical speed, greater than that reported for cycling and similar to 50 \% smaller than that of walking. These results suggest that longboarding is a novel form of physical activity that elicits vigorous intensity, yet is economical compared to walking.},

The conflict between skateboarders and the other road users has raised safety concerns for traffic engineers. Safety evaluation about skateboarder-related conflicts has not been well performed due to the low skateboarder-related crashes and the limited historical crash data. Near-crashes have been considered as surrogate data for skateboard-related safety evaluation. This paper developed a procedure to extract skateboarder-associated near-crashes automatically with the roadside Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR). A new indicator: distance-deceleration-time profile (DDTP) which combined time, space, and deceleration information was introduced for skateboarder-pedestrian near-crash identification. The DDTP was developed for the roadside LiDAR data specially. The case studies showed that the proposed method can extract skateboarder-pedestrian safety-critical events with high accuracy. The proposed method can be also used for skateboarder-vehicle and skateboarder-bicycle near-crash identification.},

Although traffic planners on campus usually did not consider skateboarding into planning due to the lack of historical skateboarding data. The traditional data collection method such as manual counting or video detection took a lot of effort and could only provide macrolevel skateboarding data. Therefore, this research presented a new approach for skateboarder detection using the roadside LiDAR sensor. A two-stage classification method was developed to distinguish skateboarders and other road users. The first stage was to classify motor vehicles and nonvehicles (pedestrians, bicycles, and skateboarders). Then the second step was to distinguish skateboarders from pedestrians and bicycles. The proposed procedure was evaluated using real-world data on campus. The results showed that the proposed procedure can detect the skateboarder with the overall accuracy of 89.5\%. The data collected in the real world showed that the speed of the skateboarder was usually higher than the pedestrian and lower than the bicycle. The skateboarding information extracted from the proposed detection method could be applied for skateboarder behavior analysis, volume counting, and safety analysis. A level-based procedure to reinforce the safety between skateboarders and pedestrians was recommended.},

Some of the questions and possible answers that I have formulated in relation to these people, their culture, their practice, their places and objects are here summarised. Although, skateboarding has at times the characteristics of a sport, and it may even appear to be one; a careful analysis reveals that it is closer to a game. The flexibility of its rules, its non-institutional nature, and its strong non-competitive character; lead us to place the skateboarding practised by these youngsters on a ludic pole. The urban condition of such practice determines its physical experiences and leaves a stamp on this practice. Are these people who skate with their skateboards along the streets looking for something? What are they looking for?},

Being this a qualitative research our main question was: in assessing sports' structure is it possible to make the characterization of any discipline through context and individuals' behaviours? The sample was within a surf discipline in a competition flowing having 5 of the top 16 Portuguese surfers training together. Based on a qualitative method, studying the surf as the main activity was an interpretative study case. The MAST was applied in four phases: taxonomy; tasks and context description; task analysis; teaching and performance strategies. Its application allowed the activities' characterization through the observation, surfer's opinions and bibliographical support. The triangulation of the data was used as an information data treatment. The elements were classified by the challenges proposed to the practitioners and the taxonomy was constituted by the sport activities, group, modality and discipline. Surf is a discipline of surfing which is a sliding sport modality, therefore, a nature sport. In the context description, we had the wave's components and constraints and the surfboards' qualities. Through task analysis we obtained a taxonomy of surf manoeuvres. The structural and functional analysis allowed finding solutions for learning of surf techniques with trampoline and skateboards because these fit in sliding sports. MAST makes possible the development of strategies that benefit teaching and performance intervention.},

	abstract = {Background: Lifestyle sport activities (e.g. parkour or skateboarding) are considered attractive and beneficial for a long-term commitment to physical activity (PA) and might be a great opportunity for adolescents who do not feel comfortable in an organized or competitive atmosphere. The purpose of the study was to assess whether participation in lifestyle activities is associated with moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA), out-of-school vigorous physical activity (VPA), and sedentary behaviour in adolescents aged 10-15years, with major demographic variables (sex, age, socioeconomic status) being taken into account. Methods: Data from a research project linked to the Health Behaviour in School-aged Children (HBSC) survey collected in 2017 in the Czech Republic was used. The sample consisted of 679 participants (303 of them girls) and was selected by quota sampling. Chi-square tests were used to assess differences in involvement in lifestyle activities according to sex, grade, and socioeconomic status. Ordinal and linear regression models were used to analyse the associations of participation in lifestyle activities and selected energy balance-related behaviours. Results: Participation in lifestyle sport activities was significantly associated with a higher level of physical activity (MVPA and out-of-school VPA) after adjustment for sociodemographic factors, as was participation in organized sport. No significant associations were shown for sedentary behaviour. Conclusions: Adolescents participating in lifestyle sport activities report being more physically active and, in case of doing multiple such activities concurrently, also spending less time sitting than their peers not involved in lifestyle sport activities. As such, lifestyle sport activities seem to represent a feasible way of increasing overall PA level in adolescent population.},

Sport performances require the athlete to disembed himself, other players, or the ball from the background, and decision-making appears to require cognitive restructuring. 26 athletes (13 men and 13 women) involved in acrobatic sports (gymnastics, trampoline, half-pipe snowboard, synchronized 3-m springboard, acrobatic rock, skateboard, and free skating) and 26 athletes (13 men and 13 women) involved in individual racket sports (tennis and table-tennis) completed the Group Embedded Figures Test. Participants (at least 10 years of practice) were from 16 to 35 years of age (M=22.0, SD=3.1). No significant difference among athletes on scores for field dependence-independence was evidenced given this expertise, sex, or age. Significantly higher scores were obtained by athletes in acrobatic sports, indicating that they tended to be predominately more field-independent whereas the lower scores were obtained by tennis and table-tennis players.},

	abstract = {Skateboarding has become a highly visible and popular activity. However, many negative stereotypes remain associated with the activity and its participants (Jones \& Graves, 2000). In contrast to the negative stereotypes, skateboarding seems to provide many individuals, and youth in particular, with an important outlet for physical activity, leisure, and personal development. The purpose of this study was to investigate why skateboarders chose to visit skateboard parks, to identify outcomes of participating in skateboarding at skateboard parks, and to identify the underlying values that guide skateboarders' choice of this specific setting. The conceptual framework for the reported study was provided by a means-end model, which views values as the key force influencing an individual's decision to engage in a particular behavior (Gutman, 1982; Manyiwa \& Crawford, 2002). The results indicate that this sample of skateboarders received a number of important benefits and, despite stereotypical views, may seek positive outcomes through skateboarding at skateboard parks. A socio-ecological model and a positive youth development framework provide a platform for interpreting the results and implications.},

	abstract = {Physical activity is commonly conceived of in terms of its human involvement - as a test of, and testament to, human ability. However, physical activity does not exist without the contributions of countless non-human agencies, such as equipment and environments, with which the athletes work closely and form relationships. As such, athletes have a unique understanding of non-human agency. In this article I analyse the power of non-human agency in skateboarding through the representations of the professional skateboarder Rodney Mullen and filmmaker Spike Jonze. I examine their lectures, interviews, and films to show the ways in which skateboarders experience, practice, and represent the principles of actor-network theory (ANT). Skateboarders utilise and manipulate the often-unanticipated potential of non-human tools and urban landscapes and translate them into a collaborative result. Skateboarding is a trial-and-error experiment of testing, innovating, and adapting possibilities and limitations set by a network of mediators including people and 'things'. Mullen and Jonze commonly depict skateboarding as the product of networks rather than independent human action. Their representations reveal how skateboarders perceive and act out their role as humans within networks alongside non-human agencies such as skateboards and obstacles, and which combine to produce skateboarding.},

	abstract = {The snakeboard is a fascinating variation of the well-known classic skateboard, and a nonholonomic structure. Therefore, a snakeboard robot is appealing for usage in control engineering education. The propulsion, which relies on cyclic movements, resembles that of many biological creatures. Hence, the challenging snakeboard modelling and motion planning received much attention in literature during the last decades. Despite all these research efforts, there is no model available in which there is a clear link between the mathematical descriptions and physical phenomena. The lack of physical insights hampers the development of a closed-loop real-time trajectory controller which is apparent by the lack of literature on such algorithms for snakeboards. In this paper, the traditional models are rewritten to obtain a model with a clear link to physical phenomena. Based on this model a closed loop controller is designed. Moreover, this rewritten model delivers the insights on actuation efficiency which are used to adapt desired trajectories a priori to more energy-efficient forms. Finally, the control and trajectory optimisation is validated by measurements on a snakeboard robot. (C) 2018 European Control Association. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

This system has multiple plates with sensors fixed to the device that moves, tilts, or deflects via the individual's movements, body lean, or gestures to provide the desired hands-free control. The upper body movement or leaning to operate this hands-free user interface can be compared to the action needed to manipulate a joystick. This solves the problem of continuous attention to the operation of a machine such as a wheelchair via one or both hands. To assess the operation of this controller it has been added to a power wheelchair to replace the joystick. The design and preliminary test results as a comparison of this controller to a previously developed hands-free dance wheel-chair are presented.},

A reduced order model is obtained, and the contributions of different terms are clearly brought out. The geometry of the castor wheels is found to play a key role in the conversion of the twisting oscillatory motion of the rider to the forward translational motion. The process of periodic gain in potential energy and its subsequent conversion to kinetic energy aids the propulsion. Interestingly, the dynamic analysis reveals that the efficacy of this propulsion mechanism tapers off as the speed increases. Rolling resistance in the wheels ultimately limits the speed of the device. The effect of various geometric and dynamic parameters on the motion and forces are studied, and optimality of design is indicated.},

Despite the dynamics and control of mechanical systems with nonholonomic constraints have been widely researched and discussed, the linearization of their equations of motion and stability analyses along different types of trajectories are more uncharted subjects. In particular, the linear stability of the forward motion with constant velocity of three nonholonomic systems is analysed: a simplified skateboard model, similar to a Chaplygin sleigh; a hoop rolling without slipping, and a torus rolling without slipping. The nonlinear equations of motion of these systems are obtained by means of a multibody system dynamics approach. Three different procedures are used to perform the linearization of the equations of motion, leading to linear systems of different sizes. The values of the resulting eigenvalues are compared and discussed for each of the previously mentioned nonholonomic systems.},

This system exhibits a very interesting propelling mechanism, since the rider can achieve a forward motion by means of an oscillatory lateral motion of the platforms, without touching the ground. Because of the complex nature of the Waveboard dynamics, a three-dimensional multibody model is proposed, modeling the wheels as two rings first and as tori later on. Some holonomic constraints arise at the contact of the wheels with the ground, while some non-holonomic constraints appear from the assumption of rolling without slipping. The equations of motion of the system are derived and a kinematic and inverse dynamics simulation of a realistic meandering trajectory is carried out, in order to understand the necessary forces and torques to obtain the desired motion. Moreover, an analysis of the influence of the design parameters on the external actions exerted by the rider is made. Finally, the multibody model is enhanced by modeling the wheels as two tori, performing a comparison between the ring and toroidal models. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

The waveboard presents an interesting propelling mechanism, since the rider can achieve a forward motion by means of an oscillatory lateral motion of the platforms. In this paper, the system is described using a multibody model with nonholonomic constraints. To study the stability of the forward upright motion with constant speed, the equations of motion are linearized with respect to a reference motion. The employed numerical linearization procedure is valid for general multibody systems with holonomic and nonholonomic constraints. In practice, the employed approach makes use of the Jacobian matrix, which is expressed in terms of any of the main design parameters of the waveboard. This paper introduces a sensitivity analysis of the eigenvalues with respect to the forward speed, the casters' inclination angle, the torsional stiffness of the torsion bar, the aspect ratio of the toroidal wheels and the mass of the human rider. Lastly, a summary with the influence of these design parameters on the external actuations exerted by the rider in the waveboard maneuvering is shown.},

	abstract = {Objective: To describe injury patterns of skateboard-associated injuries (SAIs) and to assess the frequency and severity of SAIs depending on an athlete’s skateboarding experience. Design: Cross-sectional observation. Setting: Skating areas. Participants: A total of 100 Viennese skateboarders. Interventions: No intervention. Main Outcome Measures: The participants ﬁlled in a questionnaire that was used to assess selected sociodemographic data; duration and frequency of skateboarding; “stance”; and localization, rate, as well as the severity of SAIs during the past 24 months. Skating behavior and sociodemographic data were compared with frequency and severity of SAIs.
Results: Response rate of questionnaires was 75\% (n ϭ 75) of the participants. Duration of skateboarding was 8 Ϯ 5 years, and training time was 18 Ϯ 11 hours/week. A total of 97\% (73) of the respondents reported at least one injury: in 52\% (39) of the respondents the most serious injury was mild to moderate (laceration, contusion, strain/sprain, and bruise), whereas in 45\% (34) it was severe (ligament rupture, fracture). A total of 33\% (13) of participants experiencing only mild-to-moderate injuries consulted a physician compared with 94\% (32) with at least one serious injury. The most severely affected regions were lower leg/ankle/foot in 32\% (24) of all respondents who experienced at least one severe injury and forearm/wrist/hand in 16\% (12) who experienced at least one severe injury. Only 13\% (10) used protective equipment. Multivariate logistic regression for the occurrence of at least one severe injury with all socioeconomic and sport-relevant data investigated revealed signiﬁcant positive correlations with weekly training time (P ϭ .037) and years of experience (P ϭ .021). However, after correcting for multiple testing (Bonferroni adjustment for 8 tests), no signiﬁcances remained.
Conclusion: More experienced skateboarders seem to have a greater risk of incurring severe SAIs, but sociodemographic factors seem to have no inﬂuence on injury risk in this population. Only a minority of skateboarders used protective equipment.},

	abstract = {Skateboarding is considered to be a high risk activity. Although many studies have identified risk factors associated with skateboarding injuries, few have provided detailed in-depth knowledge on participants' psychological dispositions towards risk behaviors. The aim of this study was to identify individual factors associated with risk perception and risk-taking among skateboarders. Telephone interviews were conducted with 158 skateboarders (mean age = 18.1 years) recruited in 11 Montreal skateparks. Age, self-efficacy, previous injuries, fear of being injured, sensation seeking and experience level were all included in two linear regression models that were run for risk perception and risk-taking. Age, experience level, sensation seeking, and risk perception are significant explanatory variables of risk-taking. Results show that sensation seeking was the only significant factor associated with risk perception. These results allow for a better understanding of the behavior of skateboarders, they highlight the importance of impulsive sensation seeking in risk perception as well as risk-taking. This study characterizes skateboarders who take risks and provides additional information on interventions for injury prevention. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {The World Health Organization (WHO, 2018) determines falls as the second major cause of accidental injuries leading to death and considers the research and development programs related to them a priority. With the increasing popularity of skateboarding and boardsports, medical centers have experienced an increment of injuries. Therefore, the purpose of this paper is to identify if skateboarders, and people who practice boardsports, know the risk of falls, what kind of training they have had in terms of falls, and if they consider important a specific training on safe and protected techniques from falling. For this purpose, the INFOSECA questionnaire (Campos-Mesa, Corral-Pernia, Chacon-Borrego, \& Castaneda-Vazquez, 2017) and the WHO questionnaire for the study of falls (WHO, 1989) were answered by 285 of these sportspeople (211 men and 74 women). Results revealed that 92\% of the surveyed population has fallen sometime in the last two years (49\% of them have fallen 5 or more times). Only 7\% know that WHO determines falls as the second major cause of accidental injuries, and 99\% attach great importance to the inclusion of specific training in the field of falls. In addition, more than 70\% of the population has never received any specific training in falls. The findings imply that it is necessary to introduce and develop an active intervention program in safe and protected techniques to fall, in order to minimize the consequences of accidental falls in these sports, responding to the current problem that it has been facing from different public organisms such as the World Health Organization.},

	abstract = {Skateboarding has experienced intermittent periods of popularity since the 1960s, Along with this popularity, there have been concomitant increases in numerous types of injuries, Most documented cases occur in boys aged from 10 to 14 years, with injuries ranging from minor cuts and abrasions to multiple fractures and, in some cases, even death. Although head injuries account for approximately 3.5 to 9\% of all skateboarding injuries, fractures of both upper and lower extremities account for 50\% of all musculoskeletal trauma, Not surprising is the fact that 33\% of those injured on skateboards are injured within the first week of skateboarding. Most individuals experience some form of trauma during the initial attempt at skateboarding. Because of the nature of skateboarding, encompassing both high speed and extreme manoeuvres, injuries often occur when the skateboarder collides with an immovable object, falls from the skateboard or is involved in vehicular traffic, Most injuries occur when the skateboard strikes an irregularity in the riding surface. projecting the skateboarder in the direction of travel. Despite traffic legislation. 65\% of injured adolescent skateboarders sustain injuries on public roads. Several organisations have recommended safety guidelines and restrictions based on age and common sense. Use of a helmet, knee and elbow pads, and wrist guards should be required of all skateboarders, as well as some type of formal education. The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends that children under 5 years of age should not be allowed to ride skateboards. At an early age, injuries occur due to several reasons. These include high centre of mass, immature skeletal development, an undeveloped neuromuscular system, and simply poor judgement. Skateboarding injuries are expected to rise with the increasing number of participants, high-tech equipment development and renewed advertising. Although limited preventative measures exist which will totally eradicate skateboarding trauma, some thought to actual restrictions may decrease the incidence and severity of injuries.},

	abstract = {Background. Skateboarding is a popular recreational activity but has attendant associated risks. To place this risk in perspective, participation-based rates of injury were determined and compared with those of other selected sports. Skateboard-associated injuries were evaluated over time to determine participation-based trends in injury prevalence. Methods. Rates of skateboard-associated injury were studied for the 12-year period 1987 to 1998 for participants aged 7 years or older. The National Electronic Injury Surveillance System provided injury estimates for skateboarding and the selected additional sporting activities. The National Sporting Goods Association annual survey of nationally representative households provided participation estimates. A participation-based rate of injury was calculated from these data sets for the selected sports for the year 1998. Results The 1998 rate of emergency department-treated skateboard-associated injuries-8.9 injuries per 1,000 participants (95\% confidence interval [CI], 6.2, 11.6)-was twice as high as in-line skating (3.9 [95\% CI, 3.1, 4.8]) and half as high as basketball (21.2 [95\% CI, 18.3, 24.1]). The rate of skateboard-associated injuries declined from 1987 to 1993 but is again increasing: the 1998 rate was twice that of 1993 (4.5 [95\% Cl, 1.6, 7.4] and 8.9 [95\% CI, 6.2, 11.6], respectively). Increases occurred primarily among adolescent and young adult skateboarders. The most frequent injuries in 1998 were ankle strain/sprain and wrist fracture: 1.2 (95\% CI, 0.8, 1.6) and 0.6 (95\% CI, 0.4, 0.8) per 1,000, respectively. Skateboard-associated injuries requiring hospitalization occurred in 2.9\% and were 11.4 (95\% Cl, 7.5, 17.5) times more likely to have occurred as a result of a crash with a motor vehicle than injuries in those patients not hospitalized. Conclusion. This study is the first to relate skateboarding and other sport injuries to participation exposures. We found that skateboarding is a comparatively safe sport; however, increased rates of injury are occurring in adolescent and young adult skateboarders. The most common injuries are musculoskeletal; the more serious injuries resulting in hospitalization typically involve a crash with a motor vehicle. This new methodology that uses participation-based injury rates might contribute to more effective injury control initiatives.},

Participants: Subjects age 7 years or older who sustained an injury at a local skatepark and were treated in our emergency department were included in the study. Ninety-five subjects were enrolled with a total of 97 injury encounters. Main Outcome Measurements: Types of injuries, extent of short-term disability, degree of healthcare utilization. Results: Emergency department diagnoses included 57 fractures, 6 dislocations, 15 strains/sprains/contusions, 7 lacerations, 2 dental fractures, 9 head injuries, and 1 intra-abdominal injury. Nine of the emergency department encounters terminated in admission to the hospital. The peak sum of time lost from school, work, parental time lost from work, and specialist visits were found to occur at 1 month postinjury. Similarly, the number of postinjury follow-up medical visits peaked at the 1-month interval. Subject disability was largely categorized as moderate initially, with a subsequent reduction to no disability by the 9th postinjury month. Conclusion: Skatepark-related injuries can yield substantial time lost from school and work, considerable short-term disability, and an increase in healthcare resource utilization.},

Design: Prospective case series and survey with repeat measures over 1 year. Setting: Southern California Level I Trauma Center and Emergency Department. Participants: Subjects age 7 years or older who sustained an injury at a local skatepark and treated in the emergency department were included in the study. Methods: A skatepark-related injury survey was conducted at the time of the subject's emergency department evaluation. Thereafter, subjects were contacted by telephone at 1 week and 1, 3, 6, 9 and 12 months post-injury to assess the extent of ongoing follow-up medical care, time lost from work and school for both the subject and parents, and the degree of self-reported disability. The costs of injury were estimated using accepted econometric methods. The cost of medical care and lost household productivity were estimated using data specific to the nature of the injury and the body part injured. Results: Skatepark-related injuries resulted in a mean loss of 1.1 school days and 5.5 work days to the subject and family. The mean total injury costs were \$ 3,167, of which 64\% were medical costs and 28\% were wages lost by the subject and family. Costs were much greater for subjects aged 26 years and older than for younger subjects and for those with more severe injuries than for less severe injuries. Conclusion: Skatepark injuries resulted in substantial medical costs and lost wages. Injured skatepark users 26 years and older and those with more severe injuries had the highest cost.},

	abstract = {Background-Skateboarding injuries have increased with the rise in popularity of the sport, and the injury pattern can be expected to have changed with the development of both skateboard tricks and the materials used for skateboard construction. Objective-To describe the injury pattern of today. Methods-The pattern of injuries, circumstances, and severity were investigated in a study of all 139 people injured in skateboarding accidents during the period 1995-1998 inclusive and admitted to the University Hospital of Umea. This is the only hospital in the area, serving a population of 135 000. Results-Three of the 139 injured were pedestrians hit by a skateboard rider; the rest were riders. The age range was 7-47 years (mean 16). The severity of the injuries was minor (AIS 1) to moderate (AIS 2); fractures were classified as moderate. The annual number of injuries increased during the study period. Fractures were found in 29\% of the casualties, and four children had concussion. The most common fractures were of the ankle and wrist. Older patients had less severe injuries, mainly sprains and soft tissue injuries. Most children were injured while skateboarding on ramps and at arenas; only 12 (9\%) were injured while skateboarding on roads. Some 37\% of the injuries occurred because of a loss of balance, and 26\% because of a failed trick attempt. Falls caused by surface irregularities resulted in the highest proportion of the moderate injuries. Conclusions-Skateboarding should be restricted to supervised skateboard parks, and skateboarders should be required to wear protective gear. These measures would reduce the number of skateboarders injured in motor vehicle collisions, reduce the personal injuries among skateboarders, and reduce the number of pedestrians injured in collisions with skateboarders.},

	abstract = {Skateboarding raises an interesting dilemma in the field of health promotion. While public health institutions are engaged in unprecedented efforts to counter the sedentary lifestyles of youth, the promotion of lifestyle sports and active leisure practices, such as skateboarding, is tempered by the potential risks of injuries. The health-risks associated with skateboarding have generally been viewed through the lens of epidemiology. Sociology, on the other hand, has yet to provide research on injuries that meshes with this literature. This paper addresses this absence by drawing on the works of Pierre Bourdieu to present a different perspective on the health benefits and injuries associated with skateparks. Using his concepts of 'physical capital' and 'social capital', the analysis consists of 388 days of observation (mean of 35 days in 11 skateparks) and 23 in-depth interviews with male and female skaters in Montreal, Canada. Its findings indicate that few serious injuries occurred in these skateparks and that these spaces do not correspond to the image depicted of skateboarding in previous research. From this, we suggest that skateparks should be conceived as a valuable health-resource for youth because they provide various social, psychological and physical resources that encourage a safe and active lifestyle.},

	abstract = {Background: With the increasing popularity of skateboarding, trauma centers are experiencing increased number of skateboard injuries. The incidence and type of injuries and the effect of age on these variables are poorly described in the literature. Methods: Data from National Trauma Databank during a 5-year period was used for this study. Injury Severity Score (ISS), injured body area, specific injuries, and outcomes were calculated according to age groups (younger than 10 years, 10-16 years, and older than 16 years). Results: During the study period, there were 2,270 admissions due to skateboard-related injuries (0.1\% of all trauma admissions). There were 187 patients (8\%) younger than 10 years, 1,314 patients (58\%) 10 years to 16 years, and 769 patients (34\%) older than 16 years. The overall mortality was 1.1\% and ranged from 0\% in the age group younger than 10 years to 0.3\% in the group 10 years to 16 years and 2.6\% in the group older than 16 years (p {\textless} 0.001). The incidence of severe trauma (Injury Severity Score {\textgreater}= 16) in the three age groups was 5.4\%, 13.5\%, and 23.7\%, respectively (p {\textless} 0.001). The incidence of traumatic brain injury in the three age groups was 24.1\%, 32.6\%, and 45.5\%, respectively (p {\textless} 0.001). The younger age group (younger than 10 years) was significantly more likely to suffer femur fractures and less likely to suffer tibia fractures than the older age groups. Helmets and use of a skateboard park were significant factors protecting against head injury. Conclusion: Skateboard-related injuries are associated with a high incidence of traumatic brain injury and long bone fractures. Age plays an important role in the anatomic distribution of injuries, injury severity, and outcomes. Our findings demonstrate that helmet utilization and designated skateboard areas significantly reduce the incidence of serious head injuries.},

	abstract = {The purpose of this report is to review the available literature to provide an epidemiological overview of skateboarding injuries, as well as to suggest possible areas for future research. A literature search was performed with the databases of PubMed, Sport Discus, Google and Google Scholar using the search terms 'skateboard', 'skateboarding', 'injury' and 'injuries', with all articles published in refereed journals in the English language being considered. An ancestry approach was also used. Articles from non-juried journals were also infrequently included to provide anecdotal information on the sport. Comparison of study results was compromised by the diversity of different study populations and variability of injury definitions across studies. The majority of injuries affect young males although conflicting arguments arise over the issues of age and experience in relation to injury severity. Most injuries are acutely suffered, and the most commonly affected body part was the wrist and forearm, with lower leg and ankle injuries also common. The incidence was relatively high but reports on severity differed. Clear conclusions could not be drawn on environmental location and risk factors. Most injuries tend to occur from a loss of balance leading to a fall, in more recent times due to a failed trick. Research on injury prevention is not conclusive although protective equipment and skatepark use are recommended. Further research using more rigorous study designs is required to gain a clearer picture of the incidence and determinants of injury, and to identify risk factors and viable injury countermeasures.

	abstract = {Background: Skateboard injuries have been described in the media and scientific journals as a problem prevalent among children and adolescents. Skateboarding popularity has continued to grow since the 1970s with ridership increasing to include all age groups. Recently, surgeons at one trauma centre at an urban hospital noted an increase in the number of older skateboarders with life-threatening injuries. We hypothesise that the clinical and epidemiological features of skateboard-related injuries from one trauma centre (TC) will be different from injured skateboarders identified in the U. S. National Trauma Data Bank (NTDB). We also sought to identify factors related to poor outcomes in the TC and NTDB patient groups. Methods: Two injured skateboarder patient groups were identified and compared using proportional morbidity odds ratios (PMORs) and multivariable methods to estimate differences among factors common to both groups of patients. Clinical and demographic features were evaluated for hospital admitted patients injured whilst riding a skateboard. Chi-square tests, PMORs and logistic regression were used to determine outcome differences between patients in both groups. Results: Patients in the TC group were on average older, with higher Injury Severity Scores (ISS), more head injuries requiring neurosurgical intervention, longer ICU and hospital stays, and injured more frequently on local streets than patients in the NTDB series. Poor outcomes in the TC group were related to moderate or severe head injuries and presence of a head/face injury. For NTDB patients, a GCS of {\textless}13, a head/face injury and an ISS of 25+ were related to poor outcomes. Conclusions: From our Trauma Centre we describe an older injured skateboarding population, clinically and epidemiologically different from injured patients identified in the NTDB as well as those described in the literature. The greater severity of injury, including traumatic brain injury, has direct implications for preventive and educational measures and the planning of emergency surgical response.

	abstract = {As the popularity of longboarding increases, trauma centers are treating an increased number of high severity injuries. Current literature lacks descriptions of the types of injuries experienced by longboarders, a distinct subset of the skateboarding culture. A retrospective review of longboarding and skateboarding injury cases was conducted at a level II trauma center from January 1, 2006, through December 31, 2011. Specific injuries in addition to high injury severity factors (hospital and intensive care unit (ICU) length of stay (LOS), Injury Severity Score (ISS), patient treatment options, disposition, and outcome) were calculated to compare longboarder to skateboarder injuries. A total of 824 patients met the inclusion criteria. Skull fractures, traumatic brain injuries (TBI), and intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) were significantlymore common among longboard patients than skateboarders (P {\textless} 0.0001). All patients with an ISS above 15 were longboarders. Hospital and ICU LOS in days was also significantly greater for longboarders compared with skateboarders (P {\textless} 0.0001). Of the three patients that died, each was a longboarder and each experienced a head injury. Longboard injuries account for a higher incidence rate of severe head injuries compared to skateboard injuries. Our data show that further, prospective investigation into the longboarding population demographics and injury patterns is necessary to contribute to effective injury prevention in this population.},

Methods: Hospital records of patients aged 15 and older with a skateboard injury admitted to one Level II Trauma Centre during a 10-year period were reviewed. Data on demographic, exposure, severity, diagnostic and clinical factors for patients with head injury (HI) and without HI (N-HI) were compared analytically. Results: While there were no differences for patients with HI and N-HI by age, gender, mechanism of injury or alcohol use, patients with HI were more severely injured. Although significantly more head impacts occurred to the occipital region of the head, haematomas and/or contusions were much more likely to occur in the frontal region of the brain. Acute neurosurgical intervention was needed in 14\% of HI skateboarders. Conclusion: Skateboarding is not an innocuous recreational activity, with head injury present in 75\% of patients who were hospital-admitted. Pre-hospital treatment protocols should be aware of this growing injured population. Falls while on a skateboard lead to impacts to the back of head with a contra-coup brain injury resulting in severe and sometimes fatal outcomes. The very low prevalence of helmet use among skateboarders with head injuries indicates that greater efforts should be directed toward incentives for their use.},

Results: Among participants, 47\% owned a helmet while 18\% wore a helmet on their most recent ride. Skateboarders who did not own a helmet were compared to skateboarders who owned a helmet but did not wear it and to skateboarders who wore a helmet. Positive trends for emotional benefits, friends and family cues to action and parental rules cues to action were observed. A negative trend for vanity and discomfort barriers was observed. Friends and family cues to action, parental rules cues to action and lower perceived danger were associated with helmet ownership. Friends and family cues to action were associated with helmet use. Conclusion: The findings are consistent with the thrill seeking culture of skateboarding. Implications for interventions to increase helmet use among undergraduate skateboarders are discussed.},

	abstract = {Background: The inclusion of skateboarding in the Tokyo 2020 Olympic Games reinforces this activity as a sport. As the number of skateboarders around the world and the difficulty of skateboarding maneuvers continue to increase, the number of skateboarding injuries may also rise. Thus, there is a need for more comprehensive investigations into the practice habits and injuries of skateboarders. Purpose: To describe the sports habits and skateboarding injuries of a sample of skateboarders in Spain. Study Design: Descriptive epidemiology study. Methods: A web-based survey was shared among skateboarders in Spain. The survey collected data related to sports habits, skateboarding practice habits, and injury history. Comparisons between subgroups of sex, age, and experience were also conducted. Results: The survey was completed by 197 participants (89.3\% male) with a mean age of 24.4 +/- 7.1 years and a mean experience of 9.7 +/- 7.2 years. Most respondents (87.8\%) reported not participating in any type of skateboarding-specific physical training program. Only 27.4\% took part in skateboarding competitions, with a larger number of respondents younger than 18 years participating in competitive events. The mean number of sessions per week was 3.3 +/- 1.7, and the mean length of sessions was 3.3 +/- 1.5 hours. The majority of participants (87.8\%) reported having suffered injuries (n = 323) as a result of skateboarding, mainly affecting the lower limbs (69.7\%). The most common injury type was a ligament sprain (39.6\%), especially of the ankle (39.3\%). This injury was also reported as the most likely to recur (70.1\%). A large number of injuries (54.2\%) were considered severe (ie, {\textgreater}21 days to recover). Most injuries occurred while skateboarding gaps or stairs, including any type of a jump that involved a difference in height between the take-off and landing surfaces (25.7\%). Female participants accounted for a larger number of ligament sprains than expected, and experienced skateboarders were more likely to suffer more severe injuries and head/trunk injuries. Conclusion: Respondents to this survey were mainly young male adults who practiced skateboarding recreationally. Respondents of different sexes, ages, and experiences demonstrated different habits and injury patterns. The greater number of severe injuries highlights the need for injury surveillance in skateboarding to inform better prevention and rehabilitation practices.},

	abstract = {Aim. The article deals with studying the injury rate factors in athletes with different peculiarities of mental self-regulation. Materials and methods. Male athletes aged 18-32 involved in cross-country motorcycle and bicycle races, snowboarding, and skateboarding participated in the study (n = 167). The following injury factors were taken into account: the number and severity of injuries, length of the recovery period, limitations on doing sport after recovery. The intensity of the following self-organization characteristics was assessed: determination, self-discipline, flexibility, perseverance, commitment to the current aim, and the general level of self-organization. The frequency of using the following mental self-regulation techniques during training and competitions was assessed: autosuggestion, self-persuasion, physical exercises, breathwork, auto-training, psycho-muscular training, motor imagery practice, visualization, and meditation. Results. Athletes with better-developed self-discipline and those practicing psycho-muscular training have fewer injuries while doing extreme sports. The injuries of athletes practicing psycho-muscular training are not so severe. Athletes with better determination and self-discipline recover faster after injuries. This can also be applied to those athletes who often use the techniques of autosuggestion, self-persuasion, psycho-muscular training, meditation, and visualization. Athletes with greater perseverance have fewer limitations on doing sport after recovery. This is also true for athletes practicing autosuggestion, self-persuasion, and meditation. No differences in the injury rate of cross-country motorcyclists, snow-and skateboarders were revealed. Conclusion. It is appropriate to treat the peculiarities of mental self-regulation as a factor affecting the injury rate of athletes practicing extreme sports.},

	abstract = {Purpose: To estimate the incidence of patients presenting to emergency departments (EDs) as a result of facial trauma sustained from skateboarding. Patients and Methods: The National Electronic Injury Surveillance System (NEISS) database was queried for skateboard-related head and face fractures, contusions, abrasions, and lacerations from 2009 through 2018. We identified 2,519 reported injuries, extrapolating to a national incidence of 100,201 injuries. Fractures accounted for 14.1\% of these visits. There were 355 ED visits for fractures, extrapolating to an estimated 11,893 visits nationally. Entries were tabulated for demographic information, fracture type, mechanism of injury, and disposition. Results: Patients sustaining injury to the head and face were aged 16 years, on average, and predominantly male patients (85.9\%). Most patients sustaining fractures were male patients (87.9\%), with a mean age of 18 years. The most common fracture types included unspecified skull fractures (31\%), nasal fractures (29\%), and mandibular fractures (18\%). The most common mechanism of injury was falling off the skateboard while riding (76.9\%). Collisions with motor vehicles also accounted for a substantial proportion of the injuries (7.3\%). Conclusions: A substantial number of ED visits were a result of skateboarding-related facial trauma. Given the neurologic outcomes of head trauma and functional consequences of facial fractures, especially among adolescents, our findings suggest that injury prevention programs and more aggressive helmet use may be necessary to reduce morbidity and hospitalization.

	abstract = {Objectives The broad objective of this paper is to inform policy, practice and research regarding the management of head injury risks in competitive skateboarding. The main motivation for the current study was the question of mandating helmet use in competitive skateboarding. The specific aims are to present current knowledge on (A) head injury risks in skateboarding, (B) preliminary biomechanical data on falls and head injury risks in a selection of competitive skateboarding events similar to those planned for the Summer Olympics, (C) standards for skateboard-styled helmets and (D) impact performance of helmets commonly used in skateboarding. Methods A narrative review of the published literature on head injuries in skateboarding was conducted. Videos of skateboarding competitions from Vans Park Professional League, Street League Skateboarding and Dew Tour were reviewed to describe crashes and falls. Standards databases including the International Organization for Standardization (ISO), British Standards Institution (BSI), Snell, United States Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) and American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) were searched for skateboarding-styled helmet standards. A sample of helmets considered suitable for skateboarding was tested in standard impact tests. Results The majority of previous literature focused on the paediatric population in a recreational setting with little data from competitive skateboarding. Head injuries comprised up to 75\% of all injuries and helmet use was less than 35\%. Video analysis identified high rates of falls and crashes during competitive skateboarding, but also a capacity for the athletes to control falls and limit head impacts. Less than 5\% of competitive skateboarders wore helmets. In addition to dedicated national skateboard helmet standards, there are several national standards for skateboard-styled helmets. All helmets, with the exception of one uncertified helmet, had similar impact attenuation performance; that is, at 0.8 m drop height, 114-148 g; at 1.5 m, 173-220 g; and at 2.0 m, 219-259 g. Impact performance in the second impact was degraded in all helmets tested. Conclusion Helmets styled for skateboarding are available 'off the shelf' that will offer protection to the head against skull fractures and intracranial injuries in competitive skateboarding. There is an urgent need to commence a programme of research and development to understanding and control head injury risks.},

	abstract = {Action sports (e.g., snowboarding, skateboarding, windsurfing, BMX) have traditionally celebrated antiauthoritarian, do-it-yourself and anticompetition cultural values. With the institutionalization and commercialization of action sports over the past two decades, and the introduction of mega-sports events such as the X Games, and the inclusion of some action sports into the Olympic Games (i.e., snowboarding, freestyle skiing, BMX), action sport athletes are increasingly working with coaches, psychologists, agents, managers and personal trainers to improve their performances. In this Insights paper we consider coaching in action sports via the case of Finnish professional snowboarders’ attitudes to coaches. Drawing upon conversations with elite freestyle snowboarders we briefly present insights into their perceptions of the various positions of coaches in professional snowboarding before we offer suggestions built upon a Problem-based learning approach for coaches interested in working with action sport athletes.},

The study highlights concern about organisational sell-out and decisions being made without respect to tradition. Furthermore, participants felt the sport’s identity challenged by an increased focus on competition.Implications The study recommends that shared attributes of organisational identity might form the basis for collaboration between action sports communities when working with large organisational structures such as the International Olympic Committee.},

        Determine the frequency of personal protective equipment (PPE) use in adolescent inline skaters, skateboarders, and snowboarders; explore factors influencing PPE use; identify factors that would influence use; and examine the association of high-risk behaviors and PPE use.
        Design: 
        Cross-sectional survey.
        Setting: 
        Central/southeast Wisconsin.
        Participants: 
        Participants 13-18 years-old.
        Interventions: 
        None. Independent variables = age, gender, sport.
        Main Outcome Measurements: 
        None. Dependent variables = PPE use, factors influencing use, and frequency of other high-risk behaviors.
        Results: 
        The mean age of 333 participiants was 14.9 years. Adolescents wore considerably less PPE than recommended. Inline skaters wore the most; snowboarders the least. The most common reasons adolescents wore PPE were parents, peers, and rule/requirement. Younger adolescents cited parents more often than older adolescents as a factor for PPE use. Discomfort and lack of perceived need were the most common reasons for nonuse. Sustaining/witnessing an accident was the most common reason that would convince adolescents to wear PPE. Almost half of adolescents reported nothing would convince them to wear PPE. Younger adolescents wore more PPE than older adolescents. An association was seen between PPE use in all sports and bicycle helmets. An inverse relationship was found for tobacco and helmet use among skaters, as well as alcohol and helmet use in skateboarders.
        Conclusions: 
        Adolescents underuse PPE. PPE reinforcement by parents/peers, encouraging bike helmets, manufacturing more comfortable gear, educating adolescents, and instituting PPE requirements in public areas may increase compliance. This could lead to decreased injuries. Physicians should discuss PPE with their patients/families. There may be an association between PPE use in extreme sports and decreased high-risk health behaviors.},

This study proposed a peak heuristic algorithm to detect the key temporal events of the Ollie movement during skateboarding using IMUs. The proposed algorithm was used to detect four key temporal events including take-off (TO), peak flight height (HP), front wheel landing (FL), and back wheel landing (RL). Based on these temporal events, three temporal phases including ascending, descending, and flight were identified. The results showed that our proposed method could help accurately identify these key temporal events and phases. Knowledge of the temporal information about the Ollie movement could provide a basis for quantitative assessment of riders’ performance and injury risks. Practically, this proposed algorithm can benefit the outdoor injury risk monitoring of the skateboarding movement.},

	abstract = {Background:The inclusion of skateboarding in the Tokyo 2020 Olympic Games reinforces this activity as a sport. As the number of skateboarders around the world and the difficulty of skateboarding maneuvers continue to increase, the number of skateboarding injuries may also rise. Thus, there is a need for more comprehensive investigations into the practice habits and injuries of skateboarders.Purpose:To describe the sports habits and skateboarding injuries of a sample of skateboarders in Spain.Study Design:Descriptive epidemiology study.Methods:A web-based survey was shared among skateboarders in Spain. The survey collected data related to sports habits, skateboarding practice habits, and injury history. Comparisons between subgroups of sex, age, and experience were also conducted.Results:The survey was completed by 197 participants (89.3\% male) with a mean age of 24.4 ± 7.1 years and a mean experience of 9.7 ± 7.2 years. Most respondents (87.8\%) reported not participating in any type of skateboarding-specific physical training program. Only 27.4\% took part in skateboarding competitions, with a larger number of respondents younger than 18 years participating in competitive events. The mean number of sessions per week was 3.3 ± 1.7, and the mean length of sessions was 3.3 ± 1.5 hours. The majority of participants (87.8\%) reported having suffered injuries (n = 323) as a result of skateboarding, mainly affecting the lower limbs (69.7\%). The most common injury type was a ligament sprain (39.6\%), especially of the ankle (39.3\%). This injury was also reported as the most likely to recur (70.1\%). A large number of injuries (54.2\%) were considered severe (ie, {\textgreater}21 days to recover). Most injuries occurred while skateboarding gaps or stairs, including any type of a jump that involved a difference in height between the take-off and landing surfaces (25.7\%). Female participants accounted for a larger number of ligament sprains than expected, and experienced skateboarders were more likely to suffer more severe injuries and head/trunk injuries.Conclusion:Respondents to this survey were mainly young male adults who practiced skateboarding recreationally. Respondents of different sexes, ages, and experiences demonstrated different habits and injury patterns. The greater number of severe injuries highlights the need for injury surveillance in skateboarding to inform better prevention and rehabilitation practices.},

Subjects received right-pedal shear force feedback and a criterion pattern emphasizing “effective” shear. Concurrent feedback (CFB) subjects received concurrent feedback 140 ms after the completion of every other revolution, while summary feedback (SFB) subjects received averaged feedback between trials. All subjects performed 10 retention trials without feedback 1 week later. Both groups improved significantly during practice, and performance decay in retention was negligible. Group differences during all phases were not significant. High CFB group proficiency in retention indicated that the detrimental aspects of frequent feedback were not significant. High SFB proficiency in retention suggests that large changes in kinetic patterning are achievable with relatively few feedback presentations.},

We are all aware of their often extraordinary talent and manoeuvres on the city streets. This book is the first detailed study of the urban phenomenon of skateboarding. It looks at skateboarding history from the surf-beaches of California in the 1950s, through the purpose-built skateparks of the 1970s, to the street-skating of the present day and shows how skateboarders experience and understand the city through their sport. Dismissive of authority and convention, skateboarders suggest that the city is not just a place for working and shopping but a true pleasure-ground, a place where the human body, emotions and energy can be expressed to the full.The huge skateboarding subculture that revolves around graphically-designed clothes and boards, music, slang and moves provides a rich resource for exploring issues of gender, race, class, sexuality and the family. As the author demonstrates, street-style skateboarding, especially characteristic of recent decades, conducts a performative critique of architecture, the city and capitalism. Anyone interested in the history and sociology of sport, urban geography or architecture will find this book riveting.},

	abstract = {The present study aimed to test the influence of the pedalling technique on the occurrence of muscular fatigue and on the energetic demand during prolonged constant-load cycling exercise. Subjects performed two prolonged (45 min) cycling sessions at constant intensity (75\% of maximal aerobic power). In a random order, participants cycled either with their preferred technique (PT) during one session or were helped by a visual force-feedback to modify their pedalling pattern during the other one (FB). Index of pedalling effectiveness was significantly (P{\textless}0.05) improved during FB (41.4±5.5\%); compared with PT (36.6±4.1\%). Prolonged cycling induced a significant reduction of maximal power output, which was greater after PT (−15±9\%) than after FB (−7±12\%). During steady-state FB, vastus lateralis muscle activity was significantly (P{\textless}0.05) reduced, whereas biceps femoris muscles activities increased compared with PT. Gross efficiency (GE) did not significantly differ between the two sessions, except during the first 15 min of exercise (FB: 19.0±1.9\% vs PT: 20.2±1.9\%). Although changes in muscular coordination pattern with feedback did not seem to influence GE, it could be mainly responsible for the reduction of muscle fatigue after prolonged cycling.},

	abstract = {The authors of the present study investigated the apparent contradiction between early and more recent views of knowledge of results (KR), the idea that how one is engaged before receiving KR may not be independent of how one uses that KR. In a 2 ×: 2 factorial design, participants (N = 64) practiced a simple force-production task and (a) were required, or not required, to estimate error about their previous response and (b) were provided KR either after every response (100\%) or after every 5th response (20\%) during acquisition. A no-KR retention test revealed an interaction between acquisition error estimation and KR frequencies. The group that received 100\% KR and was required to error estimate during acquisition performed the best during retention. The 2 groups that received 20\% KR performed less well. Finally, the group that received 100\% KR and was not required to error estimate during acquisition performed the poorest during retention. One general interpretation of that pattern of results is that motor learning is an increasing function of the degree to which participants use KR to test response hypotheses (J. A. Adams, 1971; R. A. Schmidt, 1975). Practicing simple responses coupled with error estimation may embody response hypotheses that can be tested with KR, thus benefiting motor learning most under a 100\% KR condition. Practicing simple responses without error estimation is less likely to embody response hypothesis, however, which may increase the probability that participants will use KR to guide upcoming responses, thus attenuating motor learning under a 100\% KR condition. The authors conclude, therefore, that how one is engaged before receiving KR may not be independent of how one uses KR.},

Individuals ranging from 18 to 75 years of age - some of them without any skills in skateboarding and others experts in this sport - were compared in their ability to anticipate and simulate a skateboarding jump by listening to the sound it produces. Only skaters were able to modulate the forces underfoot and to apply muscle synergies that closely resembled the ones that a skater would use if actually jumping on a skateboard. More importantly we showed that only skaters were able to plan the action by activating anticipatory postural adjustments about 200 ms after the jump event. We conclude that expert patterns are guided by auditory events that trigger proper anticipations of the corresponding patterns of movements.},

	abstract = {The body has become a vital research object in several disciplines in recent years. Indeed, in the social sciences and humanities, a corporeal turn in which embodiment has become a key concept related to learning and socialisation is discussed. This cross-disciplinary paper addresses the epistemological question of how we know what we know and theoretically and empirically contributes to current arguments of a shift from embodiment to emplacement. In other words, this study strives for understanding of the intersection of mind, body and place through a focus on how bodily knowing is formed as part of a moving world. The purpose of the paper is to explore the kinaesthetic experience as bodily knowing in emplaced semi-formal teaching. Through long-term ethnography in a Swedish skateboard setting and in-depth analysis of digital visual material, this paper demonstrates how kinaesthetic experience might be viewed as knowing and how a particular type of this experience might be interpreted as explosiveness and, as such, an act of physical remembrance and energy transformation. Knowing is formed along paths of movement and rhythm, and kinaesthesia is identified as a multisensory experience. It is argued that a fruitful way of bridging the mind–body divide is to view the body as un/knowing, rendering it both knowing and not knowing simultaneously. Moreover, emplaced via its senses in a sociocultural and spatio-temporal environment, this conceptualisation of a moving body in a moving world might allow for re-thinking regarding how a body in context knows, teaches and, possibly, learns.},

	abstract = {Surfing’s progeny, snowboarding and skateboarding, present similar positional, visual, and kinesthetic reafferential aspects. Such aspects lead us to the assumption of a positive knowledge transfer from skateboarding to snowboarding. In this investigation we analyzed the probability of and theories for the transfer effect under field conditions. Students of the experimental group received five skateboarding lessons. They then joined a student control group for a six-day school snowboarding trip. Both groups were videotaped on the second and sixth days of the trip. Experts rated snowboarding performance of subjects pertaining to either of groups on a scale of one (very bad) to ten (excellent) points. Inter-rater reliability
was very good. While there were no significant differences between the groups on the second day, the students of the experimental group significantly outperformed students of the control group in snowboarding
on the sixth day (Mcontrol=4.80, SDcontrol=2.10; Mtreat=6.56, SDtreat=2.10; T=-1.78, df=16, pone-tailed=.045, d=-.83). Given a common underlying structure of skateboarding and snowboarding, skateboarding lessons that develop that structure have a facilitation effect on learning how to snowboard successfully.Potomci jahanja ili daskanja na valovima (engl. surfing) – monoskijanje ili daskanje na snijegu (engl. snowboarding) i daskanje (engl. skateboarding), slični su prema pozicijskim, vizualnim i kinestetičkim aspektima. Takvo stajalište dovelo je do stvaranja pretpostavke kako je moguće očekivati pozitivan transfer naučenoga sa skateboardinga na snowboarding. U ovome istraživanju analizirali smo vjerojatnost i teorijske osnove za efekte transfera u terenskim uvjetima. Studenti iz eksperimentalne grupe proveli su 5 treninga daskanja (skateboaring). Nakon toga su se priključili kontrolnoj skupini ispitanika na šestodnevnom školskom putovanju na učenje monoskijanja (snowboarding). Ispitanici obiju grupa su snimljeni tijekom monoskijanja drugoga i šestoga dana izleta. Eksperti su ocijenili izvedbe ispitanika iz obiju grupa pomoću skale od 1 (vrlo loše) do 10 (izvrsno) bodova. Pouzdanost mjernoga instrumenta bila je vrlo dobra. Nije bilo statistički značajnih razlika između grupa u inicijalnome testiranju provedenom drugoga dana, dok su u drugom mjerenju, provedenom šestoga dana izleta, zabilježene statistički značajne razlike između grupa u korist eksperimentalne grupe (Mkont=4,80, SDkont=2,10; Meksperim=6,56, SDeksperim=2,10; T=-1,78, df=16, p=0,045, d=-0,83). S obzirom na slične osnovne strukture kretanja u daskanju i monoskijanju, treninzi daskanja su omogućili svladavanje zajedničkih struktura kretanja, čime su proizveli olakšavajuće efekte u učenju daskanja na snijegu},

	abstract = {Contemporary ways of understanding human movements, specifically movement learning, are heavily dominated by individualistic, dualistic and mechanistic perspectives. These perspectives are individualistic in the sense that in research as well as in educational practice movements/movers are typically decontextualized, they are dualistic in the sense that the body is taken to be ‘inhabited’, even ‘governed,’ by a rational mind which is not itself a part of that body; and they are mechanistic in the sense that movements and movement learning can be ‘calculated’. 
This approach has supported the dominance of a westernised and predominantly white, masculinised and heteronormative view of able bodies, embodiment and movements. Hence, it has contributed to marginalise not only other approaches and perspectives and individuals. 
New research has evolved, including new approaches and these held perspectives have been challenged by social and culturally sensitive, holistic as well as pluralistic, and dynamic/organic perspectives of human movements and moving humans. Examples of such research can be found in disciplines such as; physical education and pedagogy, ethnography, philosophy, and sociology. 
Learning Movements: New Perspectives of Movement Education provides the societal and epistemological background for these new approaches and will be essential in disseminating this knowledge to movement educators, academics and researchers as well as professionals within education, sports, health and fitness, dance, outdoor activities, etc., and that it will spearhead new and inclusive practices within these settings.},

	abstract = {Objectives Findings from the contemporary psychological and movement science literature that appear to have implications for medical training are reviewed. Specifically, the review focuses on four factors that have been shown to enhance the learning of motor skills: observational practice; the learner’s focus of attention; feedback, and self-controlled practice. Observational Practice Observation of others, particularly when it is combined with physical practice, can make important contributions to learning. This includes dyad practice (i.e. practice in pairs), which is not only cost-effective, but can also enhance learning. Focus of Attention Studies examining the role of the performer’s focus of attention have consistently demonstrated that instructions inducing an external focus (directed at the movement effect) are more effective than those promoting an internal focus (directed at the performer’s body movements). An external focus facilitates automaticity in motor control and promotes movement efficiency. Feedback Feedback not only has an informational function, but also has motivational properties that have an important influence on learning. For example, feedback after successful trials and social-comparative (normative) feedback indicating better than average performance have been shown to have a beneficial effect on learning. Self-Controlled Practice Self-controlled practice, including feedback and model demonstrations controlled by the learner, has been found to be more effective than externally controlled practice conditions. Conclusions All factors reviewed in this article appear to have both informational and motivational influences on learning. The findings seem to reflect general learning principles and are assumed to have relatively broad applicability. Therefore, the consideration of these factors in designing procedures for medical training has the potential to enhance the effectiveness and efficiency of training.

Although many studies have identified risk factors associated with skateboarding injuries, few have provided detailed in-depth knowledge on participants’ psychological dispositions towards risk behaviors. The aim of this study was to identify individual factors associated with risk perception and risk-taking among skateboarders. Telephone interviews were conducted with 158 skateboarders (mean age = 18.1 years) recruited in 11 Montreal skateparks. Age, self-efficacy, previous injuries, fear of being injured, sensation seeking and experience level were all included in two linear regression models that were run for risk perception and risk-taking. Age, experience level, sensation seeking, and risk perception are significant explanatory variables of risk-taking. Results show that sensation seeking was the only significant factor associated with risk perception. These results allow for a better understanding of the behavior of skateboarders, they highlight the importance of impulsive sensation seeking in risk perception as well as risk-taking. This study characterizes skateboarders who take risks and provides additional information on interventions for injury prevention.},

However, these observations have limited applicability in assisting with a clear understanding of body movement. In this paper, we propose the Motion Log Skateboard, which records and shares non-visible information about body movement that is difficult to obtain through current observation methods in skateboarding. A pressure-sensor matrix on a skateboard deck is used to record the pressure distribution data, which are then played using the video function of a smartphone camera. With this logged data, a user can access the feet positions, pressure intensity, and timing of the foot movements. To verify the proposed concept and determine the specific context of its use, an experimental session and interviews were conducted with skateboarders of various skill levels. Based on the results of this research, the shared experiences of non-visible information, which is perceived differently depending on the individual, are expected to become a standard for exploring and training body movement.},

	abstract = {Introduction: The body of scientific literature on sports and exercise continues to expand. The summer and winter Olympic games will be held over a 7-month period in 2021–2022.Objectives: We took this rare opportunity to quantify and analyze the main bibliometric parameters (i.e., the number of articles and citations) across all Olympic sports to weigh and compare their importance and to assess the structure of the “sport sciences” field. The present review aims to perform a bibliometric analysis of Olympic sports research. We quantified the following topics: (1) the most investigated sports; (2) the main journals in which the studies are published; (3) the main factors explaining sport-specific scientific attractiveness; (4) the influence of being in the Olympic programme, economic weight, and local influences on research output; and (5) which research topic is the most investigated across sports.Methods: We searched 116 sport/exercise journals on PubMed for the 40 summer and 10 winter Olympic sports. A total of 34,038 articles were filtered for a final selection of 25,003 articles (23,334 articles on summer sports and 1,669 on winter sports) and a total of 599,820 citations.Results and Discussion: Nine sports [football (soccer), cycling, athletics, swimming, distance \& marathon running, basketball, baseball, tennis, and rowing] were involved in 69\% of the articles and 75\% of the citations. Football was the most cited sport, with 19.7 and 26.3\% of the total number of articles and citations, respectively. All sports yielded some scientific output, but 11 sports (biathlon, mountain biking, archery, diving, trampoline, skateboarding, skeleton, modern pentathlon, luge, bobsleigh, and curling) accumulated a total of fewer than 50 publications. While ice hockey is the most prominently represented winter sport in the scientific literature, winter sports overall have produced minor scientific output. Further analyses show a large scientific literature on team sports, particularly American professional sports (i.e., baseball, basketball, and ice hockey) and the importance of inclusion in the Olympic programme to increasing scientific interest in “recent” sports (i.e., triathlon and rugby sevens). We also found local/cultural influence on the occurrence of a sport in a particular “sport sciences” journal. Finally, the relative distribution of six main research topics (i.e., physiology, performance, training and testing, injuries and medicine, biomechanics, and psychology) was large across sports and reflected the specific performance factors of each sport.},

The purpose of this study was to compare and contrast the feedback behavior of expert gymnastic coaches and less experienced coaches, as well as different feedback patterns relevant to the experience level of the gymnasts. A questionnaire was developed and completed by German gymnastics coaches. Results indicate that the main factor influencing coaches’ feedback is the skill level of the gymnasts. Furthermore, the level of coaches’ licence positively correlated with the level of the gymnasts.

was given as feedback to group 2. Both the groups practiced the task of throwing a soft
spongy ball for 6 days per week for 4 weeks, with 40 trials each day. The outcome measure
used was the distance of the throw. [Results] The results were analyzed using the t-test.
The mean distances thrown by both the groups showed highly significant improvements and
throwing distance of group 2 showed better improvement than that of group 1. [Conclusion]
Both types of augmented feedback were effective at improving skilled motor activity, but

One of the most effective ways of learning dances is to watch a video showing the performance of dance masters. However, some information cannot be conveyed well through video. One is the translational motion, especially that in the depth direction. We cannot tell exactly how far does the dancers move forward or backward. Another is the timing information. Although we can tell how to move our arms or legs from video, it is difﬁcult to know when to start moving them. We solve the ﬁrst issue by introducing an image display on a mobile robot. We can learn the amount of translation just by following the robot. We introduce active devices for the second issue. The active devices are composed of some vibro-motors and are developed to direct action-starting cues with vibration. Experimental results show the effectiveness of our multimodal information presentation method.},

The primary purpose of the proposed system is to serve as a general tool in the research on impact of different feedback modalities on the process of motor learning, for example, in sports or rehabilitation. The key advantages of the system are high-speed and high-accuracy tracking, as well as its flexibility, as it supports various types of feedback (auditory and visual, concurrent or terminal).

In Experiment 1, a movement feature that characterizes expert performance was identified. Participants (N = 8) practiced the task for 6 days. Significant changes across practice were found for movement amplitude and relative force onset. Relative force onset is considered a measure of movement efficiency; relatively late force onsets characterize expert performance. In Experiment 2, different groups of participants (N = 27) were given concurrent feedback about force onset on either 100\% or 50\% of the practice trials; a control group was given no feedback. The following hypothesis was tested: Contrary to previous findings concerning relatively simple tasks, for the learning of a complex task such as the one used here, a high relative feedback frequency (100\%) is more beneficial for learning than a reduced feedback frequency (50\%). Participants practiced the task on 2 consecutive days and performed a retention test without feedback on Day 3. The 100\% feedback group demonstrated later relative force onsets than the control group in retention; the 50\% feedback group showed intermediate performance. The results provide support for the notion that high feedback frequencies are beneficial for the learning of complex motor skills, at least until a certain level of expertise is achieved. That finding suggests that there may be an interaction between task difficulty and feedback frequency similar to the interaction found in the summary-KR literature.},

This paper presents different perspectives of feedback application related to motor skill learning in the context of competitive youth table tennis. A misleading traditional view is that the greater the feedback provided to athletes, the better the quality of coaching and learning. Indeed, this approach only enhances short-term performance in practice rather than true learning demonstrated in competition. This paper demonstrates the importance of understanding the benefits of reduced feedback frequency since skilled athletes rely more on internal feedback for learning outcomes. Coaches need to reflect on and become aware of their feedback strategies that are contradictory to the research findings. This paper will enable coaches to overcome the past mistakes in using feedback with a thorough investigation of augmented feedback as well as to ensure optimal physical and psychological learning outcomes for table tennis athletes.},

Shared-control guidance is distinct from more traditional guidance controllers, such as virtual fixtures, in that it provides novices with real-time visual and haptic feedback from a real or virtual expert. Previous studies have shown varying levels of training efficacy using shared-control guidance paradigms; it is hypothesized that these mixed results are due to interactions between specific guidance implementations (“paradigms”) and tasks. This work proposes a novel guidance paradigm taxonomy intended to help classify and compare the multitude of implementations in the literature, as well as a revised proxy rendering model to allow for the implementation of more complex guidance paradigms. The efficacies of four common paradigms are compared in a controlled study with 50 healthy subjects and two dynamic tasks. The results show that guidance paradigms must be matched to a task’s dynamic characteristics to elicit effective training and low workload.

METHODS: Forty-five junior medical students were randomized into 3 groups and learned suturing and knot-tying skills. Group A received computer-generated feedback about the economy of their movements. Group B received the same motion economy feedback, as well as expert reference values. Group C received verbal feedback from an expert. All groups were pre-tested, allowed 18 practice trials, and post-tested, and their skill retention was retested after 1 month. Performance was assessed by expert analysis using an objective structured analysis of technical skill and by computer analysis (Imperial College Surgical Assessment Device [ICSAD]).
RESULTS: All groups showed improvement from pre-test to post-test. However, only group C showed retention of skill on delayed performance testing.
CONCLUSIONS: Verbal feedback from an expert instructor led to lasting improvements in technical skills performance. Providing information about motion efficiency did not lead to similar improvements.},

	abstract = {Study Design

Randomized, experimental design using a 1-way ANCOVA to determine the influence of various forms of feedback on jump landing forces.

Objective

To investigate the effects of augmented feedback versus sensory feedback on the reduction of jump landing forces.

Background

Several investigators have reported an increased risk of lower extremity injury associated with landing from a jump.

Methods and Measures

Nonimpaired college students (N = 63) were randomly assigned to 1 of 4 feedback groups. Subjects were instructed to perform maximal vertical jumps onto a force plate for 3 testing sessions (baseline, 2-minute post-test, and 1-week post-test). Three feedback groups (augmented, sensory, and control I) were tested during all 3 testing sessions, while a fourth feedback group (control II) was evaluated at only 2 sessions (baseline and 1-week post-test). Subjects in the augmented feedback condition were provided information via video and verbal analysis of how to land softer. Subjects in the sensory feedback condition were asked to use the experience of their baseline jumps to document how they could land softer. Subjects in each of the control groups were not provided any extraneous feedback. Peak vertical ground reaction force data were collected for analysis.

Results

The subjects in the augmented feedback group significantly reduced their peak vertical ground reaction force in both post-test conditions (2-minute post-test reduction, 0.85 ± 0.62; 1-week post-test reduction, 0.74 ± 0.58) as compared to the sensory, control I, and control II feedback groups.

Conclusions

High impact landing forces may be reduced by the implementation of augmented feedback information instructing individuals about how to land properly. The reduction of jump landing forces with the use of augmented feedback may prove beneficial in the creation of instructional landing programs. J Orthop Sports Phys Ther 2001;31:511–517.},

We afterwards review the neural correlates of feedback learning mechanisms, and present a general neuroscience model of biofeedback. We subsequently show how biomedical engineering principles can be applied to design efficient feedback protocols. We finally present an integrative psychoengineering model of the feedback learning processes, and provide new guidelines for the efficient design of biofeedback and neurofeedback protocols. We identify five key properties, (1) perceptibility=can the subject perceive the biosignal?, (2) autonomy=can the subject regulate by himself?, (3) mastery=degree of control over the biosignal, (4) motivation=rewards system of the biofeedback, and (5) learnability=possibility of learning. We conclude with guidelines for the investigation and promotion of these properties in biofeedback protocols.},

However, discussion of the way to most effectively provide augmented feedback has been controversial. Related studies have focused primarily on simple or artificial tasks enhanced by visual feedback. Recently, technical advances have made it possible also to investigate more complex, realistic motor tasks and to implement not only visual, but also auditory, haptic, or multimodal augmented feedback. The aim of this review is to address the potential of augmented unimodal and multimodal feedback in the framework of motor learning theories. The review addresses the reasons for the different impacts of feedback strategies within or between the visual, auditory, and haptic modalities and the challenges that need to be overcome to provide appropriate feedback in these modalities, either in isolation or in combination. Accordingly, the design criteria for successful visual, auditory, haptic, and multimodal feedback are elaborated.},

	abstract = {Recent work has investigated the link between motor learning and sensory function in arm movement control. A number of findings are consistent with the idea that motor learning is associated with systematic changes to proprioception (Haith A, Jackson C, Mial R, Vijayakumar S. Adv Neural Inf Process Syst 21: 593–600, 2008; Ostry DJ, Darainy M, Mattar AA, Wong J, Gribble PL. J Neurosci 30: 5384–5393, 2010; Vahdat S, Darainy M, Milner TE, Ostry DJ. J Neurosci 31: 16907–16915, 2011). Here, we tested whether motor learning could be improved by providing subjects with proprioceptive training on a desired hand trajectory. Subjects were instructed to reproduce both the time-varying position and velocity of novel, complex hand trajectories. Subjects underwent 3 days of training with 90 movement trials per day. Active movement trials were interleaved with demonstration trials. For control subjects, these interleaved demonstration trials consisted of visual demonstration alone. A second group of subjects received visual and proprioceptive demonstration simultaneously; this group was presented with the same visual stimulus, but, in addition, their limb was moved through the target trajectory by a robot using servo control. Subjects who experienced the additional proprioceptive demonstration of the desired trajectory showed greater improvements during training movements than control subjects who only received visual information. This benefit of adding proprioceptive training was seen in both movement speed and position error. Interestingly, additional control subjects who received proprioceptive guidance while actively moving their arm during demonstration trials did not show the same improvement in positional accuracy. These findings support the idea that the addition of proprioceptive training can augment motor learning, and that this benefit is greatest when the subject passively experiences the goal movement.},

	abstract = {Objective: Numerous reports advocate that training of the proprioceptive sense is a viable behavioral therapy for improving impaired motor function. However, there is little agreement of what constitutes proprioceptive training and how effective it is. We therefore conducted a comprehensive, systematic review of the available literature in order to provide clarity to the notion of training the proprioceptive system.Methods: Four major scientific databases were searched. The following criteria were subsequently applied: (1) A quantified pre- and post-treatment measure of proprioceptive function. (2) An intervention or training program believed to influence or enhance proprioceptive function. (3) Contained at least one form of treatment or outcome measure that is indicative of somatosensory function. From a total of 1284 articles, 51 studies fulfilled all criteria and were selected for further review.Results: Overall, proprioceptive training resulted in an average improvement of 52\% across all outcome measures. Applying muscle vibration above 30 Hz for longer durations (i.e., min vs. s) induced outcome improvements of up to 60\%. Joint position and target reaching training consistently enhanced joint position sense (up to 109\%) showing an average improvement of 48\%. Cortical stroke was the most studied disease entity but no clear evidence indicated that proprioceptive training is differentially beneficial across the reported diseases.Conclusions: There is converging evidence that proprioceptive training can yield meaningful improvements in somatosensory and sensorimotor function. However, there is a clear need for further work. Those forms of training utilizing both passive and active movements with and without visual feedback tended to be most beneficial. There is also initial evidence suggesting that proprioceptive training induces cortical reorganization, reinforcing the notion that proprioceptive training is a viable method for improving sensorimotor function.},

This has resulted in the emotional attachment and veneration of places that are overlooked by the general public. Building on cultural geography and the literature on pilgrimage, an analysis of sacred space and secular pilgrimage is presented. Skateboarders are shown to be deeply engaged with places that have been inscribed with historic meaning. Media is shown to be instrumental in making and communicating the importance of skateboarding ‘spots’. Through textual analysis and ethnographic work a distinction is made on the importance of space. Skateboarders are shown to perform secular pilgrimages, and to be emotionally invested in the history of particular sites. Skateboarding, unlike other sports, privileges places that are not legitimate sporting locations. The stadiums of skateboarders are urban settings, handrails, curbs and steps.},

	abstract = {Movement planning is thought to be primarily determined by motor costs such as inaccuracy and effort. Solving for the optimal plan that minimizes these costs typically leads to specifying a time-varying feedback controller which both generates the movement and can optimally correct for errors that arise within a movement. However, the quality of the sensory feedback during a movement can depend substantially on the generated movement. We show that by incorporating such state-dependent sensory feedback, the optimal solution incorporates active sensing and is no longer a pure feedback process but includes a significant feedforward component. To examine whether people take into account such state-dependency in sensory feedback we asked people to make movements in which we controlled the reliability of sensory feedback. We made the visibility of the hand state-dependent, such that the visibility was proportional to the component of hand velocity in a particular direction. Subjects gradually adapted to such a sensory perturbation by making curved hand movements. In particular, they appeared to control the late visibility of the movement matching predictions of the optimal controller with state-dependent sensory noise. Our results show that trajectory planning is not only sensitive to motor costs but takes sensory costs into account and argues for optimal control of movement in which feedforward commands can play a significant role.},

We hypothesized that wave direction and surf stance interact in creating favourable or debilitative performance demands as surfers are either facing the wave (frontside) or the wave is breaking in the back of the surfers (backside). Study 1 was an online survey collecting self-report data of recreational surfers (n = 394). In Study 2, we analysed all wave scores (n = 2,552) and laterality of professional surfers during the season of 2014. Study 1 demonstrated that recreational surfers preferred surfing frontside and described themselves as more skilful when surfing frontside as this is facilitative for picking up visual information. Study 2 did not provide clear evidence that professional surfers on average scored higher during contests when surfing frontside, but when professional surfers had a choice of surfing frontside vs. backside, they were more likely to surf frontside. We discuss the diverging findings between Study 1 and Study 2 from the “circumvention-of-limits” argumentation within the expertise literature as professional surfers most likely have acquired skills allowing them to compensate for debilitative individual and environmental circumstances.},

(1997) raised theoretical concerns associated with traditional, reductionist, and mechanistic perspectives of movement coordination and skill acquisition for sport scientists interested in practical applications for training designs. These seminal papers advocated an emerging consciousness grounded in an ecological approach, signaling the need for sports practitioners to appreciate the constraints-led, deeply entangled, and non-linear reciprocity between the organism (performer), task, and environment subsystems. Over two decades later, the areas of skill acquisition, practice and training design, performance analysis and preparation, and talent development in sport science have never been so vibrant in terms of theoretical modeling, knowledge generation and innovation, and technological deployment. Viewed at an ecological level of analysis, the work of sports practitioners has progressively transitioned toward the facilitation of an evolving relationship between an organism (athlete and team) and its environment (sports competition). This commentary sets out to explore how these original ideas from Davids et al. (1994) and Handford et al. (1997) have been advanced through the theoretical lens of ecological dynamics. Concurrently, we provide case study exemplars, from applied practice in high-performance sports organizations, to illustrate how these contemporary perspectives are shaping the work of sports practitioners (sport ecology designers) in practice and in performance preparation.},

Results highlighted the influence of both age and skill level on performance (speed and accuracy), as well as on kinematics (hand, arm, hip peak velocities) of the tennis serve.

Eye tracking, visual-motor, and optometric evaluations collected during spring training 2018 were obtained from 71 professional baseball players. Pitch-level data from Trackman 3D Doppler radar were obtained from these players during the subsequent season and used to generate batting propensity scores for swinging at pitches out of the strike zone (O-Swing), swinging at pitches in the strike zone (Z-Swing), and swinging at, but missing pitches in the strike zone (Z-Miss). Nested regression models to tested which evaluation(s) best predicted standardised plate discipline scores as well as batters’ highest attained league levels during the season. Results indicated that visual evaluations relying on eye tracking (smooth pursuit accuracy and oculomotor processing speed) significantly predicted the highest attained league level andpropensity scores associated with O-Swing and Z-Swing, but not Z-Miss. These exploratory findings indicate that batters with superior visual and oculomotor abilities are more discerning at the plate. These results provide new information about the role of vision in baseball batting.},

	abstract = {Half-pipe snowboarding performance is assessed by subjective measures. Knowledge of the relative importance of objective performance indicators however can improve training and competition performance assessment. We analysed previously developed key performance indicators at the Burton Open Australian Half-Pipe Championships over three years (2006, 2007, 2008). Linear regression showed the two individual key performance indicators most strongly correlated to competition success and multiple linear regression (enter method) showed the shared variance in scores explained by these objective variables. The two objective performance variables most highly correlated with competition success were average air time (AAT) and average degree of rotation (ADR). When combined (multiple linear regression), AAT and ADR objectively explain 71 – 94\% of shared variance in subjective competition scores. We compared magnitudes of differences in AAT and ADR between athletes achieving top three (podium) final rankings and those achieving final rankings outside the top three. Magnitude of difference between athletic performances was established with a standardised (Cohen’s) effect size (ES) with 95\% confidence limits. Differences in AAT and ADR between athletes placing in the top three and those finishing outside the top three routinely showed moderate (ES = 0.6 – 1.2 95\% CL) to very large (ES {\textgreater}2.0 95\% CL) effects.},

	abstract = {Running field tests are utilised to assess the athlete’s fitness level with high specificity. However, in graded exercise tests the lack of speed control can result in an uneven pace, reducing reproducibility and accuracy. The purpose of this study was to develop feedback variants (FV) and investigate their effect on the athlete’s ability to keep the pace constant. Forty-eight participants completed four trials of a Conconi test (randomised) over four paces (7.5 − 10 km·h−1). A smartphone app provided athletes with four FVs: Classic, Sound (verbal), Vibration, and Sound \& Vibration. We found a significant effect of FV on adherence (defined as time within 0.3 km·h−1 of target speed): F(3,141) = 41.45, p {\textless} .001, η2 = .268. Adherence in Classic (M± SD) 39.51 ± 13.51\% was significantly lower (p {\textless} .001) than in Vibration (53.24 ± 14.98\%), Sound (60.34 ± 11.21\%) and Sound \& Vibration (59.17 ± 15.17\%). The novel FV provided better adherence compared to the conventional method, with Sound and Sound \& Vibration showing the highest adherence. Generally, the novel FVs have the advantage of being easily implemented and decreasing the required time for setup, data collection and processing, therefore proving useful in conducting field performance tests.},

	abstract = {Golfers continually demand more information about their performance and require immediate feedback on their swing. This research attempts to measure the pitch (Φ) and yaw (Ψ) angle of the clubhead at ball-contact and compare this to the same angle at shot set-up. Acceleration of the clubhead at ball-contact is also measured. These three variables have been linked to golfing performance in the literature. For the research two gyroscopes and one dual axis accelerometer were incorporated with a putter head. One gyroscope was positioned on the head of the club to measure deviations occurring between the yaw angle at set-up and the yaw angle at ball contact (ΔΦ). A second gyroscope was positioned to measure deviations between the pitch angle at shot set-up and the pitch angle at ball contact (ΔΦ). Each gyroscope also provides angular velocities of the club throughout the swing. To measure the clubhead acceleration (a) an accelerometer was positioned on the clubhead parallel to the movement. The system and methodology has been verified and tested for both accuracy and reliability in the field, it is those results that are presented here. Several testing techniques were used to ensure the data obtained from the sensors was accurate and compared well with kinematic data obtained from a motion analysis system. The reported RMSD error existing between the angle data obtained from the sensors (ΔΨ \& ΔΨ) and the motion analysis system was 0.20 for both the yaw and pitch angle over any two second period (sufficient for a golf stroke). The accelerometers illustrated potential benefit for use as feedback tool but proved to be inadequate as a method for deriving velocities or displacements. The output from the gyroscopes and accelerometer may be displayed in a manor such that it is a feasible means for giving valuable feedback to a golfer.},

	abstract = {Research on the influence of augmented feedback effects on both skill learning and performance has been examined from two differing positions, generally reflective of two core movement science disciplines: motor learning and biomechanics. The motor learning approach has been to examine the content and timing of feedback under tightly controlled laboratory settings, with a focus on simple tasks and the influence of movement outcome feedback. At the other end of the spectrum are biomechanical approaches, which have been primarily devoted to demonstrating the capacity of measurement technology to quantify and report on movement pattern effectiveness. This review highlights the gap left by these two approaches and argues that advancement of our understanding of feedback application in practical settings requires a shift towards a multi-disciplinary focus. A particular focus of the review is on how researchers and practitioners need to harness our understanding and subsequent application of the emergent feedback technologies most prevalent in elite sport settings and clinical sports medicine. We highlight important considerations for future applied multidisciplinary research driven by relevant theory and methodological design to more comprehensively capture how feedback systems can be used to facilitate the development of skilled performance.},

The bulk of skateboarding scholarship argues that skateboarding is largely a subversion of rule governance, a view difficult to square with common and popular rule-governed skateboarding competitions, now including the Olympics. We attempt to resolve this tension by arguing for a kind of pluralism: skateboarding’s engagement in rule-governed competition is distinctly subversive, yielding the claim that skateboarding is both sport and subversion. This pluralism is examined in an “ecological” framework of emergent activities defined by push-pull interactive relationships between skateboarders and their environment that change the meaning of their spaces—whether domestic, urban, or competitive—to spaces that are both wild and spontaneous. We conclude with reflections on how skateboarding provides understanding of sport in the space of ecological meaning.},

	abstract = {Today there is growing interest in material culture studies among a wide range of social and biological scientists. Researchers recognize that some concepts drawn from biology can be useful in understanding aspects of material culture evolution. Indeed, recent research has demonstrated that material culture can evolve in a branching manner (vertical transmission) similar to that of biological species. However, there are many complicating factors as well, particularly the human penchant for borrowing and resurrecting old ideas resulting in extensive blending and hybridization (lateral transmission). But blending and hybridization occurs in biology as well depending upon the nature and scale of interacting organisms. There is far more lateral information transfer between populations within species than between species (although there are always exceptions). History can also be expected to play a role in the degree to which evolution is affected by vertical versus lateral transmission processes. All things equal, we should expect branching to be most important early in the history of a cultural system since blending could not become significant without the early development of distinct lineages. This is different from most biological systems in the sense that the development of distinct lineages would significantly reduce (or prevent) opportunities for blending. We explore these ideas with an analysis of skateboard decks spanning the history of professional skateboards since 1963. We apply cladistic and networking models in order to develop an understanding of the degree by which skateboard evolution was affected by branching and blending/hybridization processes. The study is enhanced by a historical record that provides significant insight into the actual innovation and borrowing processes associated with skateboard evolution. Results confirm that both branching and blending played important roles and that branching was most critical early in professional skateboard history. The study offers the important implication that while cultural systems will typically incorporate far more horizontal transmission in the evolutionary process (particularly in later stages) than many biological systems, general principles governing early stage branching and disparity may apply to both.},

	abstract = {Background/methods: While usually thought of for recreation, skateboards can and are used for travel. Recreational skateboarding, an “extreme sport”, can carry a reputation for danger. What is the safety performance of skateboard travel? This study explores skateboard travel safety by (1) examining fatality and injury data, and (2) observing how skateboarders ride and how that could inﬂuence safety. Data on skateboarder injuries and fatalities are available for the United States from two national databases, news reports, and a skateboarding interest group. Observations of skateboard travelers and their travel behavior took place at the University of California, Davis, which has more than 1000 skateboard travelers. Observations include travel speed, conﬂicts with other users, and instances of potentially dangerous behavior.
Results: In California in 2012, 14 skateboarders or scooter riders were killed in collisions with automobiles; at least 10 of which occurred during travel. Utilizing mode share and trip length data from the California Household Survey, we estimate this corresponds to a fatality rate of approximately 20.9–23.0 deaths per 100 million miles traveled. Observed skateboarders travel between 6 and 14 miles per hour and 9.7 mph on average. This is very similar to bicyclists that were observed (6–19 mph range, 11.6 mph average). Additionally, observations show that skateboard travelers travel forward in straight lines and do not typically engage in aerial tricks or other unpredictable behavior.
Conclusions: Skateboard travelers, like pedestrians and bicyclists, are “vulnerable users” of the transportation system, with fatality rates per distance traveled several times greater than motor vehicle occupants, and with motor vehicle collisions a common factor. Behaviorally, skateboarders roll along at speeds slightly slower than bicyclists. Thus, skateboarding safety issues mirror bicycle safety issues, with some potential for skateboarder-pedestrian conﬂicts due to speed diﬀerentials, and skateboarder injury and fatality risk from exposure to motor vehicles.},

The dynamic instability affects the steerable wheels of a vehicle and can lead to the loss of control. While for bikes, motorbikes and airplanes the dynamics and causes of the wobble are well known and the literature fully describes the subject, for the skateboard the literature is very poor and there is no paper which investigates this type of instability. In order to do that, the skateboard equations of motion were obtained through Lagrange formalism and Lagrange multipli-ers method was used to solve the non-holonomic constraints. A parametric stability study was carried out on the linearized equations of motion and the influence of different skateboard parameters was investigated. The main discovery is that the wobble doesn't strictly depend on skateboard configuration, but the human control characteristics are predominant in the vehicle dynamics.},

Using an autoethnographical approach, we skated with each of these and reflected on our experiences in order to derive four design themes : location of feedback in relation to the skater's body, timing of feedback in relation to peaks in emotions after attempts, aspects of the trick emphasized by feedback, and aesthetic fittingness of feedback.

A number of steps were also taken in order to improve the robustness of the skateboard hardware, these included modifications to the charging circuit, power source, and addressing the sensor board's vibration susceptibility. A user study was then performed in order to determine what effect the modifications had on the usefulness of the system, focusing on the system's potential as a skateboard trick learning tool.

This system exhibits a very interesting propelling mechanism, since the rider can achieve a forward motion by means of an oscillatory lateral motion of the platforms, without touching the ground. Because of the complex nature of the Waveboard dynamics, a three-dimensional multibody model is proposed, modeling the wheels as two rings first and as tori later on. Some holonomic constraints arise at the contact of the wheels with the ground, while some non-holonomic constraints appear from the assumption of rolling without slipping. The equations of motion of the system are derived and a kinematic and inverse dynamics simulation of a realistic meandering trajectory is carried out, in order to understand the necessary forces and torques to obtain the desired motion. Moreover, an analysis of the influence of the design parameters on the external actions exerted by the rider is made. Finally, the multibody model is enhanced by modeling the wheels as two tori, performing a comparison between the ring and toroidal models.},

This is a difficult problem due to the inherent interaction between fore–aft motions and sideways motions. In this paper we propose a simple solution. Conceptually, one can avert a sideways fall by steering in that direction, similar to skateboards and bicycles. We propose to implement this concept for walking robots by the introduction of an ankle joint that kinemati-cally couples lean to yaw. The ankle joint has an unusual orienta-tion; its axis points forward and downward, without any left–right component. The effect of the ankle joint is investigated in a simple three-dimensional model with three internal degrees of freedom: one at the hip and two at the ankles. It has cylindric feet and an actuator at the hip joint, which quickly moves the swing leg to a preset for-ward position. The simulations show that it is easy to find a stable configuration, and that the resultant walking motion is highly robust to disturbances. Similar to skateboards and bicycles, there exists a critical velocity (as a function of the parameters) above which sta-ble walking motions occur. The critical velocity can be lower for a more vertical ankle axis orientation. As an additional benefit, the ankle joint allows a straightforward implementation for steering; a simple sideways offset of the mass distribution will cause the model to gently steer in that direction. The results show great potential for the construction of a real-world prototype with the proposed ankle joint.},

	abstract = {Action sports have increased in popularity, particularly over the past two decades. Research in the area has also proliferated, as multiple disciplinary perspectives and theoretical and conceptual frames have been applied to understanding and exploring a host of research questions concerning action sports culture, contexts and participants. However, despite this flurry of research activity, not much is known empirically about the learning of action sport participants, and few studies have focused specifically on learning in action sports. A scoping review was, therefore, conducted with the aim of synthesising the work that has been undertaken, and mapping future research agendas. Informed by Arksey and O’Malley’s six-stage framework, leading sports and education databases and Google Scholar were searched for empirical literature on learning in action sports published before July 2018. After the results were screened and relevant studies identified, data were extracted and analysed using a frequency and thematic analysis to form both a descriptive and thematic summary. A total of 78 empirical studies both from the peer-reviewed and grey literature were included in the scoping review. The frequency analysis concerned information on publication year, academic field, study design, study tools, sport and population. The thematic analysis led to the development of five main themes, addressing learning in social, physical, cultural, and cognitive/psychological contexts and via various forms of feedback. The majority of articles on learning in action sports were published from 2010 onward, suggesting a growing interest in the area. More theses/dissertations resulted in peer-reviewed publications; however, less than half of all reviewed journal articles were published in education/pedagogy journals. Theoretical and conceptual frameworks were rarely explicitly referenced and/or lacked clarity. There was consensus that learning in action sports is largely informal and self-regulated. With the increasing professionalisation of many action sports and their inclusion in international competition events and also in national curricula, an increase in more formalised learning is predicted. Finally, learning in action sports can be highly individualistic but only a few studies acknowledged this. A greater variety of research questions and methodologies, and more work across disciplinary boundaries will assist in the generation of new knowledge.},

	abstract = {Skateboarding started in the 1950s on the west coast of the United States of America (USA) as a response to a desire of surfers to continue their activity “when the surf was flat” This qualitative study focuses on the perception of what skateboarding is all about in South African cities and townships. In doing this, attention is also given to the skateboarding’s contribution to societal challenges in South African cities and townships. Skateboarding’s sub culture, like other youth cultures, are commonly regarded as being out of place in open public spaces as they tend to pose ‘a crisis for public space’ or resist the normative logic of public space and offer unwanted alternative uses. The problem within this context can be conceptualized as “an activity for youths involved in anti-social behavior or undesirable social behavior whereby skateboarders are in general previewed as outcasts, nuisances, and even criminals”. 

This study is closely allied to the social constructivist where the objective of research ‘is to rely as much as possible on the participants’ view of the situation being studied’. A grounded theory guideline approach was applied, thus including open axial and selective coding. Four focus group interviews were executed amongst respondents located in and around Pretoria (Menlyn, Atteridgeville, Lotus gardens and Eersterus). Themes that emerged include the need for experience, skateboarding awareness, skateboarding’s attributes and values, skateboarding as a leisure activity, skateboarding as a competitive sport, personal characters of skateboarding, and anti-criminal behavior.

Societies in general, always use the phrase “don’t judge a book by its cover”, question is, does the society apply this widely used belief system? The findings of this empirical, proof beyond questioning that society does in fact, “judge the book by its cover”.

Skateboarding could and should be considered by private industries (profit orientation and social responsibility programs) and relevant government structures (social development), as yet another element of a wider integrated social development plan},

In‐depth interviews were conducted with seven active skateboarders. Analysis of the data led to the development of a chronology of participation in the risk‐taking occupation of skateboarding. Results of this study illustrate that achieving one's best and the core value of freedom in the skateboarding subculture outweigh the risk of injury inherent to participation in the occupation. Skateboarders accept injury as an attribute of the occupation they practice and reinforce this acceptance on a social level.},

	abstract = {Weight-bearing tasks performed by humans consist of a series of phases with multiple objectives. Analysis of the relationship between control and dynamics during successive phases of the tasks is essential for improving performance without sustaining injury. Experimental evidence regarding foot landings suggests that the distribution of momentum among segments at contact inﬂuences stability during interaction with the landing surface. In this study, we hypothesized that modiﬁcation of control in one subsystem, in our case shoulder torque, during the ﬂight phase of an aerial task would enable the performer to maintain behavior of other subsystems (e.g. lower extremity kinematics) and initiate contact with momentum conditions consistent with successful task performance. To test this hypothesis, an experimentally validated multilink dynamic model that incorporated modiﬁcations in shoulder torque was used to simulate the ﬂight phase dynamics of overrotated landings. The simulation results indicate that modiﬁcation in shoulder torque during the ﬂight phase enables gymnasts to maintain lower extremity kinematics and initiate contact with trunk angular velocities consistent with those observed during successful landings. These results suggest that modiﬁcations in the control logic of one subsystem may be sufﬁcient for achieving both global and local task objectives of landing.},

	abstract = {Biomechanical feedback technologies are becoming increasingly prevalent in elite athletic training environments but how the kinematic and kinetic data they produce can be best used to improve sports techniques and enhance sports performance is unclear. This paper draws on theoretical and empirical developments in the motor control, skill acquisition, and sports biomechanics literatures to offer practical guidance and strategic direction on this issue. It is argued that the information produced by biomechanical feedback technologies can only describe, with varying degrees of accuracy, what patterns of coordination and control are being adopted by the athlete but, crucially, it cannot prescribe how these patterns of coordination and control should be modified to enhance sports performance. As conventional statistical and theoretical modelling paradigms in applied sports biomechanics provide limited information about patterns of coordination and control, and do not permit the identification of athlete-specific optimum sports techniques, objective criteria on which to base technical modifications that will consistently lead to enhanced performance outcomes cannot reliably be established for individual athletes. Given these limitations, an alternative approach, which is harmonious with the tenets of dynamical systems theory and aligned with the pioneering insights of Bernstein (1967) on skill acquisition, is advocated. This approach involves using kinematic and kinetic data to channel the athlete's search towards their own unique 'optimum' pattern of coordination and control as they actively explore their perceptual-motor workspace during practice. This approach appears to be the most efficacious use of kinematic and kinetic data given current biomechanical knowledge about sports techniques and the apparent inability of existing biomechanical modelling approaches to accurately predict how technique changes will impact on performance outcomes for individual athletes.},

It avoids direct integration of differential-algebraic equations in order to create the resulting simulations for redundant digital human models. Instead, it formulates an optimization problem by deﬁning appropriate performance measures and constraints to recover the real motion of the dynamic system. In the formulation, both kinematics and kinetics parameters serve as unknowns, and equations of motion are treated as equality constraints. Procedures to choose physical performance measures and appropriate constraints based on the available information about the bio-system are presented. The proposed methodology is illustrated and studied by ﬁrst predicting the swinging motion of a single pendulum with externally applied torque. The pendulum can represent the motion of upper and lower extremities. This simple problem has analytical solutions and is used to gain insights for the predictive dynamics approach. In addition, a complex human walking task is simulated by using the approach, and realistic results are obtained. Such motion prediction capabilities have a wide variety of applications for industries ranging from automotive to military to clinical analysis and design.},

	abstract = {Impacts are instantaneous, computationally efficient approximations of collisions. Current impact models sacrifice important physical principles to achieve that efficiency, yielding qualitative and quantitative errors when applied to simultaneous impacts in spatial multibody systems. We present a new impact model that produces behaviour similar to that of a detailed compliant contact model, while retaining the efficiency of an instantaneous method. In our model, time and configuration are fixed, but the impact is resolved into distinct compression and expansion phases, themselves comprising sliding and rolling intervals. A constrained optimization problem is solved for each interval to compute incremental impulses while respecting physical laws and principles of contact mechanics. We present the mathematical model, algorithms for its practical implementation, and examples that demonstrate its effectiveness. In collisions involving materials of various stiffnesses, our model can be more than 20 times faster than integrating through the collision using a compliant contact model. This work extends the use of instantaneous impact models to scientific and engineering applications with strict accuracy requirements, where compliant contact models would otherwise be required. An open-source implementation is available in Simbody, a C++ multibody dynamics library widely used in biomechanical and robotic applications.},

With the exception of the tail-ground interaction, all formulations are unscheduled. The model we developed was able to replicate the key phases of the ollie motion, but comparison of the ground reaction force profiles to those in the literature indicates that further development is necessary for it to be a sufficiently accurate model for biomechanical analysis. The contact models behaved as expected, however, and they could easily be applied to other problems such as robotic motion planning.},

The joint angles (ankle, knee and hip), during maximal height center of mass of participants and the skateboard, were compared using the Student’s T-test. The correlation between the center of mass of the participant and the skateboard was calculated using the Pearson Correlation. No significant differences were observed in the maximum height of the joint angles and centers of mass of the participants and the skateboard. The maximal height of the participant’s and the skateboard’s center of mass did not present a significant correlation. The results showed that there is no difference between performing the ollie skateboard maneuver with (static) or without (dynamic) a previous row.

	abstract = {PURPOSE: Sprinting, bouncing, and spontaneous landings are associated with a forefoot contact whereas walking, running, and jumping are associated with heel-toe foot placement. Because such foot placement strategies influence landing mechanics or the ensuing performance, the purpose of this work was to compare lower extremity kinematics and kinetics and muscle activation patterns between drop vertical jumps performed with heel-toe (HTL) and forefoot (FFL) landings.
METHODS: Ten healthy male university students performed two types of drop jump from a 0.4-m high box placed 1.0-m from the center of the force plate. They were instructed to either land first on the ball of the feet without the heels touching the ground during the subsequent vertical jump, i.e., forefoot landing jump (FFL), or to land on the heels followed by depression of the metatarsals, i.e., heel-toe landing jump (HTL). Three successfully performed trials per jump type were included in the analysis. The criteria for selection of the correct jumps was proper foot position at contact as judged from video records and the shape of force-time curve.
RESULTS: The first peak and second peak determined from the vertical force-time curves were 3.4 times greater and 1.4 times lower for HTL compared with those with FFL (P{\textless}0.05). In the flexion phase of HTL, the hip and knee joints contributed 40\% and 45\% to the total torque, whereas during FFL the greatest torque contributions were 37\% for both the knee and ankle joints. During the extension phase, the greatest torque contributions to the total torque were 41\% and 45\% by the knee and ankle joints during HTL and 34\% and 55\% during FFL. During the flexion phase, power production was 20\% greater (P{\textless}0.05) in HTL than in FFL, whereas during the extension phase power production was 40\% greater in FFL than in HTL. In the flexion phase of HTL the hip and knee joints produced the greatest power, and during the extension phase the knee and ankle joints produced the greatest power. In contrast, during both the flexion and extension phases of FFL, the knee and ankle joints produced the greatest power. The EMG activity of gluteus, vastus lateralis, and plantar flexor muscles was similar between HTL and FFL in most cases except for the greater vastus lateralis EMG activity during precontact phase in HTL than in FFL and the greater gastrocnemius activity in FFL than in HTL.
CONCLUSION: Foot placement strategy modifies the individual joint contributions to the total power during drop jumping.},

	abstract = {Gymnasts are exposed to a high incidence of impact landings due to the execution of repeated dismount performances. Biomechanical research can help inform recent discussions surrounding a proposed rule change in potentially injurious gymnastic dismounting. The review examines existing understanding of the mechanisms influencing the impact loads incurred in gymnastic-style landings achieved using biomechanical approaches. Laboratory-based and theoretical modelling research of inherent and regulatory mechanisms is appraised. The integration of the existing insights into injury prevention interventions studies is further considered in the appraisals. While laboratory-based studies have traditionally been favoured, the difficulty in controlling and isolating mechanisms of interest has partially restricted the understanding gained. An increase in the use of theoretical approaches has been evident over the past two decades, which has successfully enhanced insight into less readily modified mechanisms. For example, the important contribution of mass compositions and 'tuned' mass coupling responses to impact loading has been evidenced. While theoretical studies have advanced knowledge in impact landing mechanics, restrictions in the availability of laboratory-based input data have suppressed the benefits gained. The advantages of integrating laboratory-based and theoretical approaches in furthering scientific understanding of loading mechanisms have been recognised in the literature. Since a multi-mechanism contribution to impact loading has been evident, a deviation away from studies examining isolated mechanisms may be supported for the future. A further scientific understanding of the use of regulatory mechanisms in alleviating a performer's inherent injury predisposition may subsequently be gained and used to inform potential rule changes in gymnastics. While the use of controlled studies for providing scientific evidence for the effectiveness of gymnastics injury counter measures has been advocated over the past decade, a lack of information based on randomised controlled studies or actual evaluation of counter measures in the field setting has been highlighted. The subsequent integration of insight into biomechanical risk factors of landing with clinical practice interventions has been recently advocated.},

	abstract = {This study aimed to investigate how elite Chinese gymnasts manage the landing impact from a backward somersault. Six international-level male gymnasts performed backward somersault tests with a synchronous collection of kinematics (250 Hz), ground reaction forces (1,000 Hz), and surface electromyography (EMG) (2,000 Hz). A 19-segment human model was developed and lower extremity joints torques were calculated by means of a computer simulation. The angles of the lower extremity joints initially extended and then flexed. These angular velocities of extension continued to decrease and the joint torques changed from extensor to flexor within 100 ms before touchdown. The angles of the hips, knees, and ankles flexed rapidly by 12°, 36°, and 29°, respectively, and the angular velocities of flexion, flexor torque, and EMG peaked sharply during the initial impact phase of the landing. The angles of the hips, knees, and ankles flexed at approximately 90°, 100°, and 80°, respectively. The torques were reversed with the extensor torques, showing a relatively high level of muscle activation during the terminal impact phase of the landing. The results showed that the international-level gymnasts first extended their lower extremity joints, then flexed just before touchdown. They continued flexing actively and rapidly in the initial impact phase and then extended to resist the landing impact and maintain body posture during the terminal impact phase of the landing. The information gained from this study could improve our understanding of the landings of elite gymnasts and assist in injury prevention.},

A seated human pendulum was used to simulate the impact conditions consistent with landing on outstretched arms during a forward fall. Accelerometers measured the wrist and elbow response characteristics of 28 subjects following impacts with and without a wrist guard, and with elbows straight or slightly bent. Overall, the wrist guard was very effective, with significant reductions in peak accelerations at the elbow in the axial and off-axis directions, and in the off-axis direction at the wrist by almost 50\%. The effect of elbow posture as an intervention strategy was mixed; a change in magnitude and direction of the acceleration response was documented at the elbow, while there was little effect at the wrist. Unique evidence was presented in support of wrist guard use in activities like in-line skating where impacts to the hands are common. The elbow response clearly shows that more proximal anatomical structures also need to be monitored when assessing the effectiveness of injury prevention strategies.},

This is largely because each of the disciplines has a unique language and approach to research. Collaborative research is often performed serially with one discipline presenting the results of that discipline's studies to another discipline. Epidemiologists and clinicians tell engineers to design a safety technology to prevent a specific injury. Engineers tell lawyers what is feasible to include in standards. As a result, epidemiological studies lack mechanical data needed by the engineers and engineering studies lack generalizability. The procedure for incorporating the best of multiple disciplines throughout the performance of injury control studies has not existed until recently and is presented conceptually in this manuscript. This new approach, Biomechanical Epidemiology, is an exciting enhancement to current injury control research.},

	abstract = {This in-depth literature review shows that skateboarding has experienced intermittent periods of popularity, with an estimated 6–15 million skateboarders in the US currently involved at all levels of recreational play and competition. Head trauma accounts for ∼ 3.5–13.1\% of all skateboarding injuries. Injury occurs most often to the upper extremity (55–63\%), whereas thoracoabdominal and spine injuries account for 1.5–2.9\% of all trauma and lower extremity injuries occur 17–26\% of the time. Few fatal injuries (1.1\%) have been reported, oftentimes resulting from traumatic head injuries incurred from collisions with motor vehicles. Although skateparks may be perceived as a safer alternative to street skateboarding, injuries still occur when the skateboarder collides with an object or falls from the board. Factors leading to trauma include fatigue and overuse, age and skill level, inadequate medical care, environmental conditions, equipment concerns, lack of fitness and training, and the detrimental behavior of the competitor. Although not all skateboarding injuries are avoidable, numerous opportunities exist to instill safety involving education, instruction, and supervision and the proper use of protective gear to reduce predisposition to trauma. Future research recommendations include a more standardized data collection system, as well as an increased focus on kinetic analysis of the sport. Legislation involving helmet laws and the increased investment in a safer environment for the skateboarder may also assist in reducing injury in this sport.},

J Strength Cond Res 25(9): 2510-2518, 2011-The purpose of this study was to investigate changing biomechanical properties with increasing drop jump height. Sixteen physically active college students participated in this study and performed drop jumps from heights of 20, 30, 40, 50, and 60 cm (DJ20-DJ60). Kinematic and kinetic data were collected using 11 Eagle cameras and 2 force platforms. Data pertaining to the dominant leg for each of 3 trials for each drop height were recorded and analyzed. Statistical comparisons of vertical ground reaction force (vGRF), impulse, moment, power, work, and stiffness were made between different drop jump heights. The peak vGRF of the dominant leg exceeded 3 times the body weight during DJ50 and DJ60; these values were significantly greater than those for DJ20, DJ30, and DJ40 (all p {\textless} 0.004). The height jumped during DJ60 was significantly less than that during DJ20 and DJ30 (both p = 0.010). Both the landing impulse and total impulse during the contact phase were significantly different between each drop height (all p {\textless} 0.036) and significantly increased with drop height. There were no significant differences in the takeoff impulse. Peak and mean power absorption and negative work at the knee and ankle joints during DJ40, DJ50, and DJ60 were significantly greater than those during DJ20 and DJ30 (all p {\textless} 0.049). Leg, knee, and ankle stiffness during DJ60 were significantly less than during DJ20, DJ30, and DJ40 (all p {\textless} 0.037). The results demonstrated that drop jumps from heights {\textgreater}40 cm offered no advantages in terms of mechanical efficiency (SSC power output) and stiffness. Drop jumps from heights in excess of 60 cm are not recommended because of the lack of biomechanical efficiency and the potentially increased risk of injury. © 2011 National Strength and Conditioning Association.},

We conducted the measurement experiment by the snowboarder gliding on the actual snow field. The results represented the optimal joint torque of snowboarder in the snowboard turns. Furthermore, the analysis was conducted using the joint torque estimated by the proposed and previous methods. The results indicated the major and additional joint torque.

	abstract = {Vertical (VDJ) and horizontal (HDJ) double-leg rebound jumps are used as plyometric exercises in direction-specific training regimens for various sports. We investigated the effects of jump direction on joint kinetics of the take-off legs in double-leg rebound jumps. Twelve Japanese male track and field athletes performed VDJ, 100\% HDJ, 50\% HDJ (50\% of 100\% HDJ distance), and 75\% HDJ (75\% of 100\% HDJ distance). Kinematic and kinetic data in the sagittal plane were calculated using a force platform and high-speed video camera. Hip negative power during the eccentric phase decreased from VDJ to 50\% HDJ (VDJ, −4.40 ± 4.25 W/kg; 50\% HDJ, −0.83 ± 2.10; 75\% HDJ, −0.33 ± 0.83; 100\% HDJ, 0 ± 0), while hip positive power increased from VDJ to 100\% HDJ (VDJ, 4.19 ± 2.73 W/kg; 50\% HDJ, 9.37 ± 2.89; 75\% HDJ, 11.15 ± 3.91; 100\% HDJ, 18.51 ± 9.83). Knee negative power increased from VDJ to 75\% HDJ (VDJ, −14.48 ± 7.67 W/kg; 50\% HDJ, −18.98 ± 7.13; 75\% HDJ, −21.57 ± 8.54; 100\% HDJ, −23.34 ± 12.13), while knee positive power decreased from VDJ to 75\% HDJ (VDJ, 23.18 ± 9.01 W/kg; 50\% HDJ, 18.83 ± 5.49; 75\% HDJ, 18.10 ± 5.77; 100\% HDJ, 16.27 ± 6.22). Ankle joint kinetics remained unchanged. Differences in hip and knee joint kinetics between VDJ and HDJ were associated with direction control, becoming more pronounced as jump distance increased. © 2019 by the author.

	abstract = {The term foot-launched flying covers a number of sports, including hang gliding, paragliding, powered paragliding, and powered hang-gliding. The medical literature on injuries in these sports is scarce and fragmented, and these activities are often generically grouped together despite their differences in types of flight, equipment, and conditions of practice. Instead, these sports should probably be considered as sharply distinct due to their different injury dynamics and patterns. Most of the injury events in powered paragliding occur during takeoff, while in paragliding and hang-gliding they mainly occur during landing. In motorized sports, weather conditions seem to be implicated less often as a cause of incidents. Rather the engine and its thrust may be their primary cause, or may aggravate the outcome. In hang-gliding, the pilot stays in a prone position, while in paragliding the harness offers support in both standing and sitting positions. As a result, injuries to the head, the upper limbs, and cervical spine are more common in hang-gliding, while injuries to the ankle and thoracolumbar spine are more common in paragliding. Serious hand lesions caused by contact with the engine prop are specific to powered paragliding, while the head and face seem frequently affected by injuries in powered hang-gliding. These differences lead experts to believe that foot-launched flying sports should be considered separately in future studies.},

This review was conducted in accordance with the PRISMA scoping review guidelines. A total of seven electronic databases were searched (PubMed, Embase, CINAHL, SPORTDiscus, Web of Science, SCOPUS, and Ovid). Google Scholar was also searched for grey literature. Inclusion criteria were mention of surfing equipment and relevant surfing outcome measures (physiological and mechanical). Exclusion criteria were no full text availability and works not available in English. Results from these articles were then extracted, summarised and presented. A total of 17 articles were selected for review and organized by theme of board, wetsuit and fin. Fin and wetsuit design were the most prominent themes (seven studies each respectively). Most were written within the past 5 years and written in the USA. Fin design studies were largely computational, whereas board and wetsuit design were mostly field and laboratory based. Within each study theme there were consistencies in outcome measures and measuring devices. Board design studies focused on paddling efficiency (VO2 and HR). Wetsuit design studies primarily assessed thermoregulation, and less so muscle activation and paddling biomechanics. Fin design studies focused on fin shape and configuration to assess lift and drag properties. Three key themes of board, wetsuit and fin design were noted; from this the authors were able to identify several knowledge gaps such as a lack of standardisation in equipment controls and study design procedures. Alongside improving standardisation, the use of wave pools presents as an area of interest in future research.},

	abstract = {While the culture of sports as a passive entertainment (i.e. being a spectator) is universal and easily accessible by almost everyone (mainly through the media), the same does not hold true for active participation in sports. Low participation in sports is partly due to the fact that current sport design concepts are addressed to those parts of the population that are relatively young and healthy, highly skilled and motivated, and in many cases, at least moderately educated with a fair buying capacity. Therefore, designers face now the challenge of making sport practice enjoyable, accessible and safe for a broad range of the population including minorities that have been traditionally excluded such as the elderly, disabled people, people living in deprived areas, people from lower socioeconomic strata and certain minority ethnic and religious groups.Design for Sport explores how design in its broadest sense can contribute to make sport practice widespread in the general population as well as among disadvantaged and hard-to-reach groups, and discusses the impact and challenges of this process. It also intends to present case studies about the design for sport as well as to examine how compelling user-centered design methodologies - such as participatory design techniques and the use of appropriate ethnographies - can be successfully applied in the process of sport design.An important aspect will feature examples in which the users themselves have influenced the evolution of design for sport. For example, the increased sophistication of sports equipment used in Paralympic sport has evolved to meet the demands of the athletes.The book will start by introducing the issue of design in sport and will define the aspects of design that will be discussed in the chapters that will follow. To put the issue of sports design in context, it will then give an account of the evolution of sport practice, and other health or appearance-promoting leisure-time physical activity and exercise. Thereafter it will cover different crucial aspects of socially responsible design for sport such as product, game (rules) and environment design to improve sport accessibility (e.g. for disabled people, the less wealthy and certain minority ethnic groups with cultural or religious sensitivities ); interface and information design for excluded minorities, such as the elderly. It will also present useful ethnomethodologies and Participatory Design (PD) techniques that can be used to understand the users' needs and requirements in their specific contests as well as to evaluate the designed systems. Finally, it will investigate the broader impact of social responsible design for sport in terms of social wellbeing and economic development and environmental sustainability.},

	abstract = {In the standard inverse dynamic method, joint moments are assessed from ground reaction force data and position data, where segmental accelerations are calculated by numerical differentiation of position data after low-pass ﬁltering. This method falls short in analyzing the impact phase, e.g. landing after a jump, by underestimating the contribution of the segmental accelerations to the joint moment assessment. This study tried to improve the inverse dynamics method for the assessment of knee moment by evaluating different cutoff frequencies in low-pass ﬁltering of position data on the calculation of knee moment. Next to this, the effect of an inclusion of direct measurement of segmental acceleration using accelerometers to the inverse dynamics was evaluated. Evidence was obtained that during impact, the contribution of the ground reaction force to the sagittal knee moment was neutralized by the moments generated by very high segmental accelerations. Because the accelerometer-based method did not result in the expected improvement of the knee moment assessment during activities with high impacts, it is proposed to ﬁlter the ground reaction force with the same cutoff frequency as the calculated accelerations. When this precaution is not taken, the impact peaks in the moments can be considered as artifacts. On the basis of these ﬁndings, we recommend in the search to biomechanical explanations of chronic overuse injuries, like jumper’s knee, not to consider the relation with impact peak force and impact peak moment.},

platform (600 Hz) was synchronized with a Peak high speed camera (120Hz) to collect the volleyball jumping action. Sixteen volleyball players (8 males and 8 females) were the
subjects of the study. The results revealed that the work done in knee joints during eccentric contraction were greater than ankle and hip joints in both two volleyball jumps. In addition, the hip has a greater work contribution on both hop and step-close jump.},

Twelve division III male basketball players voluntarily participated in this study. They performed three trials of the running single leg jump with two approach speeds (fast and preferred) randomly. The kinematic data were collected by motion analysis system (200 Hz), and kinetic data were collected using the AMTI force platform (1000 Hz), and electromyography (EMG) data were recorded by the Delsys surface Electromyography (EMG) system (2000 Hz). Kinematic, kinetic and EMG signal were synchronized using EvaRT 4.6. Peak Ground reaction force, eccentric loading rate (ELR), gastrocnemius (GA) of pre-activation phase, and tibialis anterior (TA) of push-off phase were found significantly larger in the fast approach speed (p \&lt; 0.05). RSJ improves muscle activation level and stretch reflex. Higher activation of TA and GA during RSJ may have the benefit of decreasing risk of injury and jump training. Thus, it is helpful in muscle stretch adaptation.},

	abstract = {• Motivated by a number of skateboard-related injuries seen in an emergency department, we undertook an investigation of skateboarding injuries in the mid-1980s. We studied US Consumer Product Safety Commission injury frequency estimates, which indicated a resurgence of these injuries: 19182 in 1984 and 37 180 in 1985. Children 10 to 14 years old were injured with greatest frequency. Nontrivial injuries were more common among children younger than 5 years old, reflecting a larger proportion of head and neck injuries. Boys sustained more frequent and more severe skateboard-related injuries. Observed injury patterns (head and neck injuries in younger children, extremity injuries in older children, and more severe head and neck injuries in older children) probably reflect the role of psychomotor development on both risk exposure and biomechanics. Likely prevention strategies include warnings against skateboard use by children younger than 5 years, prohibition of skateboards on streets and highways, and the promotion of use of helmets and other protective gear.(AJDC. 1991;145:188–193)},

	abstract = {Background—Skateboarding injuries have increased with the rise in popularity of the sport, and the injury pattern can be expected to have changed with the development of both skateboard tricks and the materials used for skateboard construction.
Objective—To describe the injury pattern of today.
Methods—The pattern of injuries, circumstances, and severity were investigated in a study of all 139 people injured in skateboarding accidents during the period 1995–1998 inclusive and admitted to the University Hospital of Umeå. This is the only hospital in the area, serving a population of 135 000.
Results—Three of the 139 injured were pedestrians hit by a skateboard rider; the rest were riders. The age range was 7–47 years (mean 16). The severity of the injuries was minor (AIS 1) to moderate (AIS 2); fractures were classified as moderate. The annual number of injuries increased during the study period. Fractures were found in 29\% of the casualties, and four children had concussion. The most common fractures were of the ankle and wrist. Older patients had less severe injuries, mainly sprains and soft tissue injuries. Most children were injured while skateboarding on ramps and at arenas; only 12 (9\%) were injured while skateboarding on roads. Some 37\% of the injuries occurred because of a loss of balance, and 26\% because of a failed trick attempt. Falls caused by surface irregularities resulted in the highest proportion of the moderate injuries.
Conclusions—Skateboarding should be restricted to supervised skateboard parks, and skateboarders should be required to wear protective gear. These measures would reduce the number of skateboarders injured in motor vehicle collisions, reduce the personal injuries among skateboarders, and reduce the number of pedestrians injured in collisions with skateboarders.},

Four children had concussions (one with a fractured skull), 8 others had minor head injury, and 23 had soft tissue injuries of the head and neck. As for the reasons for the accidents, 20 per cent were due to hitting a stone, 10 per cent to a hole or bump in the pavement, 8 per cent to collisions, and three accidents to faults in the skateboards. Sixteen of the children were injured on the first day of their skateboarding. The role of protective clothing was uncertain. The city has no skateboard parks.

	abstract = {Skateboarding is one of the most popular extreme sports of today. The basic mathematical model, describing the motion of a skateboard with the rider has been proposed by M. Hubbard [1,2]. Recently this model has been developed by A. S. Kuleshov and his co-authors [3-5]. However all these studies don't take into account the rider control of the skateboard i.e. the considered model of the skateboard is incontrollable. The first attempt to introduce the control into this system was made in the paper [2]. This work remains apparently unique study devoted to the skateboard control. In our presentation we discuss various schemes for the control of a skateboard. Obviously it is possible to use the simple feedback control for stabilization of the skateboard with the rider as in [2]. At the same time it is clear that essentially all the degrees of freedom of the system experience hard servo-control on the part of the rider. Therefore we propose the method of control of a skateboard with the help of servo-constraints. The basic ideas on the mechanical systems with servo-constraints have been formulated by H. Beghin [6] and developed by Yu. F. Golubev [7]. In our investigation we essentially used the theory treated in these papers. (C) 2010 Published by Elsevier Ltd.},

In general, this tool is made using wood material taken from nature and vulnerable to environmental damage issues. In this research, the waste of banana stems will be processed into the main raw material for skateboarding. The type of material chosen is the type of composite material with banana stem waste selected as reinforcement and polyester resin as the matrix material. The purpose of this research is to design and manufacture a skateboard made of composite fiber reinforced banana stem fibers and to test its flexural strength to obtain the characteristics of the material formed. The design was carried out with the help of the 2007 version of Autocad software by following commercial skateboard standards.  Flexural testing was carried out at the Impact and Fracture Research Center laboratory, Faculty of Engineering, University of North Sumatra. Static static testing of polymer composite board specimens from banana stems obtained the average value data for the composition of 5\% banana stems is 9.81 MPa, for the composition of 10\% banana stems an average of 13.60 MPa, and composition of 15\% banana stems the average is 27.20 MPa. 2. The analysis shows that the best composition is 15\% of banana stems, with an average flexural strength value of 27.20 MPa. Therefore, the composition used in this study is the composition of 15\% reinforcement of banana stems.},
