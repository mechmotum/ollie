\subsection{Settings}\label{s_settings}
\noindent The NLP tolerance is set to $1e^{-8}$, and the mesh tolerance is set to $1e^{-3}$. The amount of mesh sections for the first two phases are set to 30, phase 3 is set to 10 mesh sections. The landing phase is not as important as the preparation and upward motion phase as those define the final height and thus the objective.
